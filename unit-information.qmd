This is a quick overview of the unit covering how it is structured, how we commumnicate and what is expected of you.

## Modules
BEDA is divided into **three modules**, each taught by a different lecturer. The modules vary in length on purpose. 

- **Module 1**, led by Januar Harianto, covers the essentials of statistics from a fresh angle. If you are "new" to stats, this module will set you up well, focusing less on the traditional approach of picking the “right” test and more on understanding why and how to build a solid statistical model to answer your research questions.
- **Module 2**, led by Clare McArthur, critically assesses study designs that have already been done. Using real data examples, we will look at how variations in study design can influence the results. You will notice that the concepts from Module 1 are applicable to more complex models. You will also start working on Report 1 which requires you to design and analyse an experiment.
- **Module 3**, led by Mathew Crowther, focuses on the application of statistical techniques to real-world data that is often complex and messy and how to deal with it using multivariate techniques. You will start working on Report 2 which requires you to collect and analyse data from your environment, rather than a controlled experiment.

## Announcements
We will post all important updates and announcements on [Ed (also known as Edstem)](https://edstem.org/au/dashboard). Please get into the habit of checking it regularly (i.e. daily). **It is up to you to stay on top of these announcements. Any special consideration requests or emails that are due to a lack of awareness of announcements will not be considered.**

## Lectures and practicals

**Attending lectures and practicals is mandatory.** We monitor attendance in practicals, and your participation is crucial since you'll be working on assessments in groups. Your presence is important for your own learning and for supporting your peers. Each week, there are two lectures and one practical.

- **Tuesday Lecture**: 10:00am - 11:00am, [BHB Lecture Theatre 1110](https://maps.sydney.edu.au/?room=H70.01.1110)
- **Wednesday Lecture**: 10:00am - 11:00am, [Carslaw Lecture Theatre 159-259](https://maps.sydney.edu.au/?room=F07.02.159-259)
- **Practical Sessions**: Your practical will be on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday from 2:00pm - 4:00pm or 4:00pm - 6:00pm in [Carlsaw Wet Lab 307](https://maps.sydney.edu.au/?room=F07.03.307).

Make sure to check your personal timetable for your specific practical session time.

## Assessments

To pass this unit, you must complete and submit all assessment tasks. Importantly, Report 1 and 2 are compulsory assessments you will fail the unit if you do not submit them.  For more information on the assessments, please see the [Assessments](assessments/assessments.qmd) page.
