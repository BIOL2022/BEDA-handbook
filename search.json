    "text": "BEDA is assessed through a combination of quizzes, reports, and (as usual) a final exam. The assessments are designed to test your understanding of the material and your ability to apply it in practical scenarios.\n\n Early Feedback Task (EFT) - 5%\nThis is a short quiz, designed to give you early feedback on your prior understanding of statistics. It will help you identify areas where you may need to focus your study efforts.\nDetails Submission link\n\n\n Evaluation Quiz (Module 1) - 10%\nThis is a quiz that covers key ideas about statistics and how experiments are set up based on Module 1. The higher score of two attempts will be recorded, so you can learn from the feedback instead of being penalised for them. More importantly, we hope that you use this quiz as a means of reflection, rather than a test of your knowledge.\nDetails Submission link\n\n\n Report 1 (Module 2) - 25%\nYou will use what you have learned so far to design and analyse an experiment based on a project of your choice. The experiments will be completed in groups, but the reports are individually written and assessed. You will have 6 weeks to complete it.\nRole of Practicals:\nPracticals are designed to be flexible and student-driven. Rather than following a set procedure, you are encouraged to use practical sessions to seek feedback on your project ideas, experimental design, and analysis plans. Demonstrators act as advisors, similar to how support works in a research group, and you are welcome to interact with them and your peers for advice, just as you would with postdocs or supervisors. If you are organised, you can also request feedback on your report drafts during practicals to help improve your work.\nDetails Submission link\n\n\n Report 2 (Module 3) - 20%\nReport 2 is similar to Report 1, but you will need to focus on a project with a multivariate context. Note that there is a 5% group work component to this report that will be assessed via dataset submission, and the report is individually written and assessed (15%). You will have 5 weeks to complete the report.\nRole of Practicals:\nPracticals are a mix of structured and unstructured sessions. Each practical begins with a brief workshop to practice a specific analysis technique, followed by time for you to work on your project. Some practicals are dedicated feedback sessions, for example we will prioritise giving feedback on your experimental design and analysis plans in Week 10. As usual, you are welcome to interact with demonstrators and your peers for advice and feedback.\nDetails Submission link",

    "text": "Science is about asking the right questions in the right way so we can draw meaningful conclusions from the data we collect. This is not as simple as it seems, but it is a key skill in scientific enquiry. We need to be able to ask questions in a quantitative way to distinguish between different explanations for the things we observe. Before we start using t-tests, regression, or ANOVA; before we perform mixed modelling or moltivariate analyses; before we use the newest tools for data analysis, we must first learn to ask the right questions. So let’s go back to basics.\nIn this module:\n\nLectures (Weeks 1 –5) will cover the fundamental principles of scientific enquiry, including how to ask the right questions, how to design a study, and how to interpret results. We will also introduce to you the linear modelling framework, which is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between variables in your data.\nPracticals (Weeks 1–3) aim to help you build the essential skills for scientific enquiry. We will cover experimental design, model formulation, and sampling design. Each week begins with a short 30-minute workshop to introduce the main ideas and techniques. You will then complete the practical work.",

Pick one and have a go at following the tasks outlined in the cheatsheet. These cheatsheets are designed by Januar and are meant to reduce the stress of learning new software. They are not meant to be comprehensive, but they will help you get started.\n\n\n3.2 Give a cheatsheet a try\nYou will need a web browser to open the cheatsheets. If you are reading this online, you can click here:  Cheatsheets. This link is always available in the sidebar.\n\nYou will see a list of cheatsheets. We will add more as we get your feedback and questions on Ed.\nPick a cheatsheet – maybe something you have never used before, or one you know well to see if it helps you learn something new.\nFollow the steps on the cheatsheet. If you get stuck, do not panic! Ask your friends or a demonstrator, and feel free to give feedback so we can make the cheatsheets even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNow is your chance to try out different software for the same task. For example, try using R and Jamovi to plot the same data. You might find you prefer something different!\n\n\nWhen you are done, please give us feedback on the cheatsheet(s) you tried. There is a quick form on the cheatsheets page – it only takes a minute and really helps us out! You may also request for new cheatsheets to be added – Januar will make them for you as you progress through the unit.x\nYour feedback helps us make the cheatsheets better for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to help improve the cheatsheets? (Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to go a step further and contribute to the cheatsheets, we would love your suggestions! You can:\n\nEmail Januar with your ideas – that is totally fine!\nPost a comment on Ed. We will discuss and update the cheatsheets together.\nSubmit a pull request on GitHub. This is a bit more technical, but if you know how, go for it! The link to the GitHub repo is on the cheatsheet.\n\nIf your changes are accepted, you will be credited as a co-author. Your work will be part of the unit’s resources, and you can even mention it on your CV or portfolio! Ask Januar if you want to know more.\nYou can suggest or contribute at any time during the semester, so do not stress if you are busy now. We will keep updating the cheatsheets regularly.",

    "section": "4 Exercise 2 – Introduction to statistical models",
    "text": "4 Exercise 2 – Introduction to statistical models\n\n4.1 What is the point?\nOne of the most important parts of study design is being able to model data. One way to do this is with plots – they are not just pretty pictures, but actually capture the heart of your study design. In this exercise, you will get to grips with what a model is and how it helps you plan and analyse experiments.\n\n4.1.1 What is a model?\nA model is just a simple way to represent something complicated. In data analysis, a model helps us make sense of a dataset, test ideas (hypotheses), or make predictions. Models can be as simple or as fancy as you like, depending on your data and your research question.\nSoon, you will be using what is called an empirical model. It might look like a scary equation, but you do not need to be a maths genius to get the idea.\nHere is an example:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\]\nThis just means: “the value of \\(y\\) is equal to a constant, plus \\(x_1\\) times another constant, plus a bit of random error.”\nBut we can make it even simpler by thinking of it as a relationship:\n\\[y \\sim x_1\\]\nThis means: “\\(y\\) is influenced by \\(x_1\\).”\nSo if \\(y\\) is weight and \\(x_1\\) is age, it is:\n\\[\\text{weight} \\sim \\text{age}\\]\nIn other words, “weight depends on age.”\n\n\n4.1.2 Plots as models\nFor now, let us focus on graphical models – in other words, plots! Plots are models because they show relationships between variables. For example, you could plot the weight of an animal species against its age or height to see if there is a pattern:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, how we consider your variables can drastically change the type of plot and model used for data analysis. For example, consider the same relationship as above, but plotted differently:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how both plots show the same kind of relationship, but the way we interpret them – and the type of model we use – is different. This is what study design and data analysis are all about: the model you choose can totally change your results, so planning ahead is key!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you can plot it, you are already modelling it!\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 What do you need?\n\nMS Excel (or similar) to look at the data files\nWord, Google Docs, or just pen and paper to sketch your models\nR, Jamovi, SPSS, or any software you fancy for plotting\nData: penguins.csv and possum.xlsx (grab them from Canvas)\n\n\n\n4.3 What do you do?\nStep 1. Download and have a look at the data: penguins.csv and possum.xlsx.\nStep 2. Pick out some variables from the data and think about how you could model them. You do not need to analyse the data in detail – just focus on what the variables are and how they could be modelled. Try these:\n\nHistogram – shows the distribution of a variable. Think: what kind of data would make a histogram skewed to the right?\nScatterplot – shows the relationship between two variables.\nBoxplot – compares two or more groups.\nBarplot – compares groups, but with error bars. Think: what do the error bars mean? Why might you pick a barplot over a boxplot?\n\nStep 3. For plots that compare two or more variables, think about how you could change the way you collect data to use a different model. Is your idea logical and doable?\nStep 4. These plots are linked to specific empirical models and statistical analyses, which we will cover soon. Can you guess what kind of statistical model you would use for the data in Steps 1 and 2? Do not worry if you are not sure yet – chat about it with your friends and demonstrators.\nYou should hand-draw your models on your new notebook for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the possum data in Excel. Let’s think about how the weight of a possum changes with age.\nWhat kind of variables are these? Are they continuous, categorical, or something else? With that in mind, sketch the plot(s) you think will help you understand the data. Weight is continuous and age is categorical, so a boxplot is a good start.\nWhat if you collected age in years instead of categories? Then you could use a scatterplot. But maybe you can’t tell a possum’s exact age, so that might not be practical.\nThe first model would probably use a two-sample t-test, while the second could use linear regression.\n\nA model comparing the weights of juvenile and adult possums could be shown as a boxplot or barplot. Here’s a boxplot of the possum data:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\npossums &lt;- read_excel(\"possums.xlsx\", sheet = 2)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(possums, aes(x = Age, y = BW)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how thinking about how to interpret the data is a big part of study design? It helps you decide what data to collect and how to analyse it. But notice – there is only one juvenile possum in the dataset, so you could not really analyse this properly!\nFood for thought: Can age still be used to construct a model given that there is only one juvenile possum?",

Keep “Data Type” as Sample Data. Clear button “Title”.\nCheck to ensure you have the correct number of rows and columns and all looks well.\nGo to Edit, go to Factors, go to Add and name your new factor(s) appropriately, code each site for that factor and press OK.\nGo to Pre-treatment and then to Transform (overall), and select an appropriate transformation for your data. (4th root or presence/absence, etc1.)\nTo make an nMDS plot: Go to Analyse then Resemblance and click ‘analyse between samples’ and ‘Bray-Curtis similarity’. Go to Analyse then to Non-metric MDS, change number of restarts to 20 and select configuration plot. You can modify how the nMDS plot is displayed by right clicking on the figure.\nTo perform a PERMANOVA you need to firstly create a PERMANOVA design, and then run the PERMANOVA you have designed\n\nTo create a PERMANOVA design: Return to the resemblance matrix. Go to PERMANOVA+ then Create PERMANOVA design. Create a title for the design and select appropriate number of factors. Enter in each factor you want to incorporate into the design, and code as either fixed or random factor. Complex designs can be created at this point.\nTo run the PERMANOVA: Return to the resemblance matrix. Go to PERMANOVA+ then PERMANOVA. Select the correct design (usually the highest number). Select Mains test and your permutational method (reduced model is usually fine), the sum of squares type (type III) and the number of permutations (999 recommended) then OK.\n\nInterpret the PERMANOVA output. If one or more of your factors are significant, then you run the PERMANOVA design again, selecting Pair-wise test and select the factor/interaction of interest. Press OK.\nIf appropriate, return to transformed data set and go to Analyse and then SIMPER. Select appropriate factor and click OK.\nSave result(s) to a file.\n\n\n\n4.2 ANOSIM\nAs an alternative to PERMANOVA, many studies will test differences between treatments using Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM). Unlike PERMANOVA which can be used for multi-factorial designs, ANOSIM is best used for simple one-factor analyses. PERMANOVA and ANOSIM will generate the same (or very similar results) for one-factor analyses.\n\n4.2.1 To perform an ANOSIM\nReturn to resemblance matrix, go to Analyse then to ANOSIM, select appropriate factor which you added before.\nSignificance level in % in ANOSIM becomes probability if divided by 100. e.g. 0.2 ÷ 100 = 0.002 = P (in this case P &lt; 0.05). If ‘Significance level of sample statistic’ in ‘Global Test’ section of the output is more than 5 (which is &gt; 0.05), than there is no significant difference among any of the treatments even if ‘Pairwise Tests’ section has significant differences between pairs of particular treatments. ANOSIM results are presented as: (P = 0.076, Global R = 0.148, 999 permutations) where P is a global significance level.",

    "text": "5 For next week\nOur first steps involve organizing the data so that we can get it into our analytical software (SPSS, PRIMER, R etc,) and generating summary statistics and figures. Different analytical software requires slightly different formats but there are usually some generalities that apply across programs.\nFor the start of next week’s practical each group will need to have collated their group data into three spreadsheets; These spreadsheets will be marked out of 5 by demonstrators.\n\nHabitat data: an SPSS or R ready excel file with sites as rows and habitat variables as columns (see below)\nAssemblage/Community data: a PRIMER or R ready excel file with species ID as rows and sites as columns (see below)\nSummary statistics: additional excel files as above (1 and 2) but with summary statistics (numbers of spp., individuals, habitat variables etc.) calculated for your data. This may be done on a site specific or treatment specific basis depending on your question.\n\n\n5.1 1. Your habitat data for PCA\nHabitat data – You will need to enter your data on habitat characteristics into SPSS or R for analysis next week. Make sure you are familiar with how to organise it for SPSS. Every site needs its own row where every habitat variable measured is listed, i.e. every site assessment has an independent row. If you have treatments you need to include a column labeling those treatments too (in addition to “site name”).\n\n\n5.2 2. Organising and entering assemblage data for PRIMER\nAssemblage/Community data – You will need to generate your spp*site matrix into a PRIMER ready file so that we are ready to analyse your data at the labs next week. These will take the form of a spreadsheet with a single column identifying species (unique species identifiers are fine) with the abundances for each site in rows (page 22). This sheet must start in the top left cell of that worksheet with only a single row of column labels. Make sure that you keep a reference file where you have recorded the specific identity of the unique species identifiers (e.g. A= Toyota Corolla, B= Leyland P76 etc.).\n\n\n5.3 3. Generating summary statistics for additional (univariate) analyses\nOn an additional spreadsheet/workspace, you should calculate summary statistics to perform additional univariate analyses. Create a copy of your completed excel file and or worksheet. You should generate a column in the far right of your spreadsheet summing the number of things in each row. You can then sort the data (REMEMBER TO SELECT IT ALL!) by that column and delete all the zero rows (i.e. no evidence of that species in your system).\nOwing to the high degree of variation and the number of singletons you will encounter it is possible (and likely) that some groups will pool species into more coarse groupings (i.e. “genera” or “family”).\nThe easiest way to calculate some of these summary statistics will be to use the pivot table command in Excel to sort your data for you. To do this:\n\nHighlight the dataset you want to use\nChoose Pivot Table from the Data menu\nWork through the wizard creating a pivot table in a new worksheet\nThen change the drop down menu in the box to “to data area” and click on the different sites to add them.\n\nYou should have a functional summary pivot table of your data. You can change the pivot tables to look at “counts” (equivalent of presence absence data) or “sums” (abundance data) for your spreadsheet.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of data sheet for importing data into SPSS for PCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of data sheet for importing data into PRIMER",

As the lectures outline, this accessibility has given rise to the uncritical use of methods leading to inappropriate analyses being used to deal with multivariate data sets. At the very least, biologists need to have a working understanding of how to choose appropriate tests and how to identify when someone has chosen poorly.\nSome of the more common uses of multivariate approaches permit us to describe complex patterns simply, identify patterns of groupings in complex data sets and test statistical hypotheses using multivariate datasets.\nIn this section of the unit, you will be able to practice performing these multivariate techniques using sample data sets. Then you need to demonstrate your ability to use these multivariate methods to analyse data that you will collect in groups to highlight the nuances of different techniques. Whilst best practice normally dictates that we would normally decide on appropriate tests before we collect our data, this task will enable us to explore options for analysis more effectively.",

We can study the assemblages of different cars (as analogues of “species”) that inhabit different suburbs and look at some characteristics of their car parks (as analogues of “habitat use”). See the sample proforma attached illustrating how we can generate a multivariate system with testable hypotheses using car assemblages and the car parks they inhabit as an example.\n\n\n4.3 Groups\nIn groups, you will need to create your own non-biological multivariate system. Using this model system, come up with several (2 to 3) multivariate hypotheses relating to the assemblages of “species” in different “treatments” (2 factor design is encouraged) and the “habitat variables” that may be influencing “habitat use”. Make sure that your treatments are adequately replicated (you will need at least 3 of each treatment). You will need to make a sampling technique in your groups that will allow you to collect the data necessary to test your hypotheses. You should also decide who will co-ordinate the data preparation.\nEach group will present a short (&lt;5 min) presentation during the practical session in Week 10 (week 2 of the pracs). For this, you will have a short powerpoint presentation containing the following information. This is compulsory for this unit: This enables staff to give feedback so you can collect the appropriate data for analyses in the next 2 weeks. Note this feedback is meant to be friendly, we are not upset or angry if we point out flaws in your design.\n\nan introduction to your system (model species and your treatments);\nyour hypotheses (there should be 2 or 3);\na description of your taxonomy;\nyour sampling design (including information on sampling effort and sample sizes);\nthe habitat variables you will be measuring at each site (and how you will measure them);\na map of your sites",

    "text": "5 Assessment\nTo make sure that you get the most time to analyse the data and understand its interpretation, you will bring your data in week 11 to be checked by demonstrators. This is a group assessment so only one member of your group needs submit the data file for the whole group. This is worth 5% of your assessment, with near perfect datasets getting the full 5%. It is a group assessment, so Special Considerations, Simple Extensions and Academic Plans do not apply.\nFor the final assessment, each student will write a short report. The emphasis on the report will be on the methods and results sections, reflected in the attached marking scheme. You do not have to use your imagination in regard to references/ reasons for the study, but are welcome to. You do need to include your hypotheses in the Introduction section.\nThe report will consider the work you did and the ways you analysed it. It must be no longer than four single-spaced typed pages (not including the cover sheet, a title page with the abstract or any pages of references, figures and tables) and will be in the form of a manuscript suitable for submission to Austral Ecology. This report will focus on the methods you used, in particular how you describe your analyses, the type(s) of data you collected and how you present your results.\nYour report is due at 11:59pm on Sunday, before STUVAC. We hope to return reports with summative feedback a week later. Your report should be submitted electronically, anonymously (use your SID for identification) through Canvas.\nDo not plagiarise or copy from others:\n\nCheck the website http://sydney.edu.au/students/academic-integrity.html for access to the policies and codes covering academic honesty and conduct at the University\nWe will take marks off if you have obviously used ChatGPT. You are welcome to use it to check grammar, or even R codes, but we can tell if you have used it extensively to write your reports.

    "section": "",
    "text": "BEDA is designed with the assumption that you have some prior experience with statistics from your first year of study. Most of you will have completed a unit like ENVX1002 or DATA1001, which provide a solid foundation in statistics. However, the only formal prerequisite for BEDA is the completion of at least one first-year science unit (see Enrolment Rules for details). We strongly encourage those of you who have not completed a first-year statistics unit to consider doing so before enrolling in BEDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you still choose to enrol in BEDA without prior statistics experience, please be aware that you will need to invest extra time and effort to catch up. BEDA is not designed to teach statistics from the ground up as this has already been covered in your first-year units!\n\n\n\nHow to gauge your readiness\nTo help you determine if you are ready for BEDA, we have translated the key foundational concepts into a short self-assessment. Before starting this unit, you should be able to:\n\nExplain a p-value: What does a p-value represent? How would you interpret a p-value of 0.03 in the context of a biological experiment?\nUnderstand correlation: What is the difference between positive and negative correlation? Why does correlation not necessarily imply causation?\nIdentify data types: Can you distinguish between continuous, discrete, and categorical data and provide a relevant example for each?\nDescribe central tendency: When is it more appropriate to use the mean versus the median to describe the centre of a dataset?\nOutline hypothesis testing: What are the core steps involved in hypothesis testing, including the roles of the null and alternative hypotheses?\nInterpret statistical tests: Can you explain the main purpose of a t-test and a simple linear regression? Could you define what a ‘confidence interval’ or ‘standard error’ tells you about your results?\n\nThe first few weeks of BEDA will include a review of these concepts, but we will not be teaching them in detail. If you are not familiar with these topics, we recommend reviewing them before the unit begins, either through online resources or by reading introductory statistics textbooks. Two that we recommend are available in the Library and are linked below:\n\nExperimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists by Quinn and Keough\nBiometry: the principles and practice of statistics in biological research by Sokal and Rohlf",

    "section": "3 Exercise 1 – Modelling from observations",
    "text": "3 Exercise 1 – Modelling from observations\n\n3.1 Background\nImages are commonly used to quantify patterns in biology, from molecules to ecosystems. In ecology, for instance, satellite images and aerial photographs are used in some ecological studies to quantify patterns of distribution and abundances of animals and plants across habitats.\nHere you will explore experimental design, model formulation and data analysis by collecting data from available images and use both evidence and logic to work out how to explain the patterns you observe.\nWork in groups – You will be working in groups of 3-4 students. Your task is to observe the images provided and formulate a model that explains the patterns you observe. You will then create a study design that will allow you to test your model.\nRemember, the best models are often the simplest. Focus on logical and critical thinking when designing your study. The sampling design certainly the bigger focus here in this short exercise. Keep this in mind as you work through the exercise!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not proceed to Exercise 2 until you have completed this exercise, and a Demonstrator has sighted your study design.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Getting started\nYou are provided with random, representative, replicate photographs of a common marine habitat that spans &gt; 8,000 km of the Great Southern Reef, i.e. the coastline along the bottom half of Australia – intertidal rocky shores (Fig 1).\nAccess the images, including background information, here (note: link will open in a new window/tab).\nUsing these images and the species identification guide, formulate a model and a (testable) hypothesis. You will then think about what data you need to collect to test your hypothesis. See below for further details.\n\n\n3.3 Study design\nFocus on the sampling design as you work on your model. Keep this in mind as you work through the exercise. If overwhelmed, think simple – the focus is on working through these sampling design considerations explained in this week’s lectures:\n\nControl\nReplication\nRandomisation\n\nHave a clear model in mind before collecting data. The model determines your sampling strategy and the type of data you need. Consider the following:\n\nWhat is the point of your model? Think about the biological question you are trying to answer, and the kinds of data you need to collect to answer it. Remember that the model is a simplified representation of reality, so it should be as simple as possible while still capturing the essence of the question you are trying to answer.\nThink of how you would collect data to test your model. What are the variables you need to measure? How would you measure them?\nScrutinise your images with the model in mind. Can the data be collected representatively from the images? Are there issues of replication or confounding variables that you need to consider?\nDo you have the time and resources to complete the study in the time frame provided, i.e. by the end of next week?\nWhat is your backup plan if data assumptions are not met?\n\nWhile you may not have all the answers right away, it’s important to have a rough idea of what you want to do, such as comparing groups, measuring correlation, or creating a linear model.\n\n\n\nThe Great Southern Reef. © 2021 California Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Task\nA Google Docs page is available for you as a guide to record your responses. On the document, select File &gt; Download to save the file to use in your group. Note that this document is a guide and you may choose to use a different format to record your progress.\nThen, address your study design by answering the following questions:\n\nModel and hypothesis: What is your model and hypothesis? What are you trying to test and how will you test it? What would the plot look like?\nVariables: What are the variables you need to measure? What types of variables are they (e.g. continuous, categorical)?\nData collection: How would you collect data to test your model? What are the potential issues you need to consider?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this example will probably not work for the images, but it should give you an idea of what is expected. Also note that you do not need to follow the template exactly!\n\nProject title: Does rock size influence the number of species that can be found on a rocky shore?\nGroup name: Schist happens\n\n\nModel and hypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesise that the number of species on the rocky shore is positively correlated with the size of the rocks.\nWe will model the relationship between the number of species and the size of the rocks using a linear model.\nThe plot is expected to be a scatter plot with the number of species on the y-axis and the size of the rocks on the x-axis.\n\nVariables:\n\nWe need to measure the number of species and the size of the rocks.\nNumber of species is an integer variable.\nSize of the rocks is continuous variable.\n\nSampling design, control, replication, randomisation:\n\nFor each image, we will divide it into a 10x10 grid.\n3 random quadrats will be selected from each grid.\nThe size of all visible rocks will be measured in each quadrat.\nThe number of unique species in each quadrat will also be counted.\nWe will then calculate the average size of rocks and the average number of species for each image to minimise pseudoreplication.\nPossible confounding could arise from the presence of seaweed, which could affect the number of species present.\nIf the number of species is too high to count, we will group species into functional groups and count the number of functional groups instead.\n\nBackup plan:\n\nIf the assumptions of the linear model are not met, we will transform the data, otherwise we will attempt a non-linear model.",

    "text": "4 Exercise 2 – data entry\nIt is time to sample data from the images. While doing so, consider how you might minimise bias in your sampling. Also, if have not already done so, plan for time:\n\nHow long will it take to sample data from each image?\nHow many images will you sample from?\nHow many samples will you take from each image?\n\nEnter your data into a spreadsheet as soon as you have them. You can use any spreadsheet software you like (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers). Google Sheets is easiest if everyone in your group is sampling and entering data at the same time as it is easy to set up a shared spreadsheet, but you may also share the same computer and enter data one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss\n\n\n\nIf more than one person is entering data, will it influence the results?

    "text": "6 Exercise 2 – Data analysis\n\n6.1 Fitting a model to data\nRecall that you have an empirical model e.g. y ~ x. You will need to use an appropriate statistical model to fit this relationship to your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should already know what model you are fitting to your data as it it part of your study design!\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Checking assumptions\nAssumptions need to be checked as they basically tell you whether the model you have fitted is appropriate for your data. If the assumptions are not met, you may need to transform your data or use a different model.\nCommon assumptions include:\n\nNormality (of residuals)\nHomogeneity of variance\nIndependence of observations\n\nWe recommend looking at residual plots, rather than formal tests of assumptions. Formal tests of assumptions can be overly sensitive to large sample sizes and can lead to you rejecting a model that is actually appropriate for your data.\nWhat to do if assumptions are not met? This is a common problem in data analysis, and interestingly, it is not always a problem. Provided that you have ensured that your data is representative of the population you are interested in, violations of normality can actually be ignored in many cases, although you should still report them. A larger problem is homogeneity of variance.\nNevertheless, you get to decide on what to do here to avoid violation of assumptions. The first step would be to try and transform your data. If this does not work, you will need to use a different model or a non-parametric equivalent of the model you are using.\n\n\n6.3 Statistical testing\nRunning the statistical test is probably the least eventful part of the analytical workflow and will take you a few seconds regardless of the software you are using, especially if you are running GLMs. Make sure that you record the software used and the specific statistical technique selected such that the analysis is reproducible.\n\n\n6.4 Interpretation\nInterpreting the output of a statistical test is a skill that takes time to develop. You will need to be able to:\n\nUnderstand the important parts of the output e.g. F-statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, etc.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your data.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your research question.\n\nYour lectures and this week’s workshop will help you develop these skills.\nYour data may not be interpretable due to the way it was collected. This is ok – a lesson learnt. You can still discuss the issues with the data and what you would do differently next time. Meanwhile, you can still practice your data analysis skills on your data (or download another group’s data).",

Use the datasets below to repeat Exercises 1 and 2. Some hints:\n\nTry to add more than one predictor to your model and see how the output changes.\nUse your understanding of data structure to determine if you have set your model up correctly – i.e. is that variable really numeric?\nThe data may need to be cleaned before you can analyse it. This is a good opportunity to practice your data cleaning skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn top of what you have been taught so far (linear regression and t-test), you will most likely create models that are equivalent to Analysis of Variance, Multiple Linear Regression and Analysis of Covariance techniques. These will be touched on in the next few weeks but you can get a head start now – that’s the beauty of GLMs!\n\n\n\n7.0.1 Weight data for domestic cats\nHandy hints:\n\nRead the metadata if you are unsure what the variables mean.\nYou can look at the relationships between the continuous variables for each gender of cat. Is there a way to combine these relationships into one model?\nCan Sex be used as a response variable in this model? You don’t have to do this, but it is an interesting question to consider.\n\n{{&lt; downloadthis assets/cats.xlsx dname=\"cats\" label=\"Download cats.xlsx\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" &gt;}}\n\n\n7.0.2 Cherry trees\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset seems very simple and should be easy to analyse… or is it?\nUse what you have learnt about simple linear regression and add more predictors to your model!\nThink about the assumptions of the model and whether they are met. Do you need to alter your interpretation of these diagnostic plots in any way?\n\n{{&lt; downloadthis assets/cherry.xlsx dname=\"cherry\" label=\"Download cherry.xlsx\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" &gt;}}\n\n\n7.0.3 Effects of dietary protein on pigs\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset is messy and may need to be tidied up before you can analyse it.\nThink of how the idea of a t-test, which compares two groups, can be extended to this dataset where you are comparing multiple groups. Does this change the way you need to set up your model?\nAre you brave enough to look for interactions between variables?\n\n{{&lt; downloadthis assets/pigs.xlsx dname=\"pigs\" label=\"Download pigs.xlsx\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" &gt;}}\n\n\n7.0.4 Sugar cane disease data\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset is a bit more complex than the others. You may need to spend some time understanding the variables before you can analyse the data.\nYou do not need to use all the variables in your analysis. There are two possible response variables in this dataset - you can choose which one to use.\n\n{{&lt; downloadthis assets/cane.xlsx dname=\"cane\" label=\"Download cane.xlsx\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" &gt;}}",

The modules vary in length on purpose.\n\nModule 1, led by Januar Harianto, covers the essentials of statistics from a fresh angle. If you are “new” to stats, this module will set you up well, focusing less on the traditional approach of picking the “right” test and more on understanding why and how to build a solid statistical model to answer your research questions.\nModule 2, led by Clare McArthur, critically assesses study designs that have already been done. Using real data examples, we will look at how variations in study design can influence the results. You will notice that the concepts from Module 1 are applicable to more complex models. You will also start working on Report 1 which requires you to design and analyse an experiment.\nModule 3, led by Mathew Crowther, focuses on the application of statistical techniques to real-world data that is often complex and messy and how to deal with it using multivariate techniques. You will start working on Report 2 which requires you to collect and analyse data from your environment, rather than a controlled experiment.",
