    "text": "Modules\nBEDA is divided into three modules, each taught by a different lecturer. The modules vary in length on purpose.\n\nModule 1, led by Januar Harianto, covers the essentials of statistics from a fresh angle. If you are “new” to stats, this module will set you up well, focusing less on the traditional approach of picking the “right” test and more on understanding why and how to build a solid statistical model to answer your research questions.\nModule 2, led by Clare McArthur, critically assesses study designs that have already been done. Using real data examples, we will look at how variations in study design can influence the results. You will notice that the concepts from Module 1 are applicable to more complex models. You will also start working on Report 1 which requires you to design and analyse an experiment.\nModule 3, led by Mathew Crowther, focuses on the application of statistical techniques to real-world data that is often complex and messy and how to deal with it using multivariate techniques. You will start working on Report 2 which requires you to collect and analyse data from your environment, rather than a controlled experiment.",

This means that you are responsible for picking a time and place that maximises your ability to complete the quiz without interruption, which includes having a stable internet connection.\nTime limit: The quiz has a time limit of 40 minutes. In reality it should take you much less time than that to complete the quiz. The additional time is for unforeseen circumstances.\nResources: The quiz is open book. This means you can use any resources you have available to you, including the internet, your notes, and the course materials. The reason for this is that as an evaluation tool, we hope that you use it as a learning opportunity. There is no point in cheating as you will only be cheating yourself out of evaluating your own understanding of the material. Most of you should do well if you have been keeping up with the content anyway.\nAttempts: you will have two attempts to complete the quiz. The highest score will be recorded. No extra chances will be given for any reason outside of technical issues. A technical issue is defined as a problem with the quiz itself. Internet connection issues will not be good reasons for extra attempts.\nDue: You have about 7 days to complete both attempts of the quiz once it is opened. Note that this is approximate.\nThe quiz consists of multiple choice (one correct answer) and multiple answer (more than one correct answer) questions.\n\nBack to assessments"

This applies to those who have trouble installing R and RStudio on their computer, and still prefer this to the other software options.\n\nYou must have both installed on your computer. If you already have them installed, please ensure they are up-to-date. Once installed, ensure that you run R via RStudio Desktop, and not the base R GUI.\n\n\nJamovi and JASP\n\nDownload Jamovi from here.\nUnless you have a reason to not use Jamovi, download JASP from here.\nFor JASP, refer to JASP Materials for documentation and more. JASP has an interface that is almost identical to Jamovi, so it will not be covered in detail here.\n\nFor Jamovi, the current branch is recommended. Remember — if you are on a Mac with Apple Silicon, download the arm64 version for slightly better performance.\n\n\nSPSS\n\nSPSS is only available on University computers. Check your lab computers for availability.\nAlternatively, you can use the University’s Citrix Workspace to access SPSS. Note that using Citrix is not a common solution for statistical software. Your demonstrators are not trained in Citrix, so they will probably need to troubleshoot with you to get it working.\n\nWhile I do not use SPSS myself, we do provide support for it in BEDA. It is somewhat of a mixed bag at present, as it has R integration, is point-and-click, and also has a syntax editor for scripting analyses. If you would prefer not to use Citrix, PSPP is an excellent free alternative to SPSS. It has a very similar interface and syntax, and because it is free software, it will not expire or require separate licences for advanced features.\n\n\nPRIMER v7\n\nThis software is only used in Module 3 when we cover multivariate analysis.\nSimilar to SPSS, PRIMER is only available on University computers.\nThere is currently no free alternative to PRIMER v7 unless you can use R fluently. You must use the University computers to access it.\nWhen we get to Module 3, we will provide more information on how to access it.",

    "text": "Science is about asking the right questions in the right way so we can draw meaningful conclusions from the data we collect. This is not as simple as it seems, but it is a key skill in scientific enquiry. We need to be able to ask questions in a quantitative way to distinguish between different explanations for the things we observe. Before we start using t-tests, regression, or ANOVA; before we perform mixed modelling or moltivariate analyses; before we use the newest tools for data analysis, we must first learn to ask the right questions. So let’s go back to basics.\nIn this module:\n\nLectures (Weeks 1 –5) will cover the fundamental principles of scientific enquiry, including how to ask the right questions, how to design a study, and how to interpret results. We will also introduce to you the linear modelling framework, which is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between variables in your data.\nPracticals (Weeks 1–3) aim to help you build the essential skills for scientific enquiry. We will cover experimental design, model formulation, and sampling design. Each week begins with a short 30-minute workshop to introduce the main ideas and techniques. You will then complete the practical work."

    "text": "6 Exercise 2 – Data analysis\n\nFitting a model to data\nRecall that you have an empirical model e.g. y ~ x. You will need to use an appropriate statistical model to fit this relationship to your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should already know what model you are fitting to your data as it it part of your study design!\n\n\n\n\nChecking model assumptions\nBefore interpreting your results, it is important to check that your chosen model is suitable for your data. This means assessing whether the data meet the assumptions required by the model. If these assumptions are not met, your results may be misleading.\nThe main assumptions for general linear models are:\n\nNormality of residuals: The differences between observed and predicted values (residuals) should be roughly normally distributed.\nHomogeneity of variance: The spread of residuals should be similar across all levels of your predictors.\nIndependence of observations: Each data point should be independent of the others. This is assumed, so we do not need to test it explicitly.\n\nThe simplest way to check these assumptions is by examining residual plots. Formal statistical tests are available such as the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, but they can be overly sensitive (especially with large datasets) and may suggest problems where none exist.\nRemember, minor violations of normality are often not a major concern (can you explain why?), but large differences in variance can seriously affect your conclusions. Always discuss any issues and how you addressed them in your analysis.\n\n\nViolation of the normality assumption is often ignored when sampling is large, as the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYour demonstrators may show you how to transform variables to better meet the assumptions of your chosen model.\n\n\n\n\nRunning models\nRunning the model is probably the least eventful part of the analytical workflow and will take you a few seconds regardless of the software you are using, especially if you are running GLMs. Make sure that you record the software used and the specific statistical technique selected such that the analysis is reproducible.\n\n\nInterpretation\nInterpreting the output of a statistical model is a skill that takes time to develop. You will need to be able to:\n\nUnderstand the important parts of the output e.g. F-statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, etc.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your data.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your research question.\n\nYour lectures and this week’s workshop will help you develop these skills.\nYour data may not be interpretable due to the way it was collected. This is ok – a lesson learnt. You can still discuss the issues with the data and what you would do differently next time. Meanwhile, you can still practice your data analysis skills on your data (or download another group’s data).",

Use the datasets below to repeat Exercises 1 and 2. Some hints:\n\nTry to add more than one predictor to your model and see how the output changes.\nUse your understanding of data structure to determine if you have set your model up correctly – i.e. is that variable really numeric?\nThe data may need to be cleaned before you can analyse it. This is a good opportunity to practice your data cleaning skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn top of the simple models you have been taught so far (e.g., using a single continuous or categorical predictor), you will see how the GLM framework can be extended to include multiple predictors of different types. These will be touched on in the next few weeks but you can get a head start now – that’s the beauty of GLMs!\n\n\n\nWeight data for domestic cats: cats.xlsx\nHandy hints:\n\nRead the metadata if you are unsure what the variables mean.\nYou can look at the relationships between the continuous variables for each gender of cat. Is there a way to combine these relationships into one model?\nCan Sex be used as a response variable in this model? You don’t have to do this, but it is an interesting question to consider.\n\n\n\nCherry trees: cherry.xlsx\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset seems very simple and should be easy to analyse… or is it?\nUse what you have learnt about simple linear regression and add more predictors to your model!\nThink about the assumptions of the model and whether they are met. Do you need to alter your interpretation of these diagnostic plots in any way?\n\n\n\n(Extra challenge) effects of dietary protein on pigs: pigs.xlsx\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset is messy and may need to be tidied up before you can analyse it.\nThink of how a model with a two-level categorical predictor (which compares two groups) can be extended to a predictor with multiple levels to compare multiple groups. Does this change the way you need to set up your model?\nAre you brave enough to look for interactions between variables?\n\n\n\n(Extra challenge) Sugar cane disease data: cane.xlsx\nHandy hints:\n\nThis dataset is a bit more complex than the others. You may need to spend some time understanding the variables before you can analyse the data.\nYou do not need to use all the variables in your analysis.

    "text": "3 Exercise 1 – Modelling from observations\n\nBackground\nImages are commonly used to quantify patterns in biology, from molecules to ecosystems. In ecology, for instance, satellite images and aerial photographs are used in some ecological studies to quantify patterns of distribution and abundances of animals and plants across habitats.\nHere you will explore experimental design, model formulation and data analysis by collecting data from available images and use both evidence and logic to work out how to explain the patterns you observe.\nWork in groups – You will be working in groups of 3-4 students. Your task is to observe the images provided and formulate a model that explains the patterns you observe. You will then create a study design that will allow you to test your model.\nRemember, the best models are often the simplest. Focus on logical and critical thinking when designing your study. The sampling design certainly the bigger focus here in this short exercise. Keep this in mind as you work through the exercise!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not proceed to Exercise 2 until you have completed this exercise, and a Demonstrator has sighted your study design.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\nYou are provided with random, representative, replicate photographs of a common marine habitat that spans &gt; 8,000 km of the Great Southern Reef, i.e. the coastline along the bottom half of Australia – intertidal rocky shores (Fig 1).\nAccess the images, including background information, here (note: link will open in a new window/tab).\nUsing these images and the species identification guide, formulate a model and a (testable) hypothesis. You will then think about what data you need to collect to test your hypothesis. See below for further details.\n\n\nStudy design\nFocus on the sampling design as you work on your model. Keep this in mind as you work through the exercise. If overwhelmed, think simple – the focus is on working through these sampling design considerations explained in this week’s lectures:\n\nControl\nReplication\nRandomisation\n\nHave a clear model in mind before collecting data. The model determines your sampling strategy and the type of data you need. Consider the following:\n\nWhat is the point of your model? Think about the biological question you are trying to answer, and the kinds of data you need to collect to answer it. Remember that the model is a simplified representation of reality, so it should be as simple as possible while still capturing the essence of the question you are trying to answer.\nThink of how you would collect data to test your model. What are the variables you need to measure? How would you measure them?\nScrutinise your images with the model in mind. Can the data be collected representatively from the images? Are there issues of replication or confounding variables that you need to consider?\nDo you have the time and resources to complete the study in the time frame provided, i.e. by the end of next week?\nWhat is your backup plan if data assumptions are not met?\n\nWhile you may not have all the answers right away, it’s important to have a rough idea of what you want to do, such as comparing groups, measuring correlation, or creating a linear model.\n\n\n\nThe Great Southern Reef. © 2021 California Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n\nTask\nA Google Docs page is available for you as a guide to record your responses. On the document, select File &gt; Download to save the file to use in your group. Note that this document is a guide and you may choose to use a different format to record your progress.\nThen, address your study design by answering the following questions:\n\nModel and hypothesis: What is your model and hypothesis? What are you trying to test and how will you test it? What would the plot look like?\nVariables: What are the variables you need to measure? What types of variables are they (e.g. continuous, categorical)?\nData collection: How would you collect data to test your model? What are the potential issues you need to consider?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this example will probably not work for the images, but it should give you an idea of what is expected. Also note that you do not need to follow the template exactly!\n\nProject title: Does rock size influence the number of species that can be found on a rocky shore?\nGroup name: Schist happens\n\n\nModel and hypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesise that the number of species on the rocky shore is positively correlated with the size of the rocks.\nWe will model the relationship between the number of species and the size of the rocks using a linear model.\nThe plot is expected to be a scatter plot with the number of species on the y-axis and the size of the rocks on the x-axis.\n\nVariables:\n\nWe need to measure the number of species and the size of the rocks.\nNumber of species is an integer variable.\nSize of the rocks is continuous variable.\n\nSampling design, control, replication, randomisation:\n\nFor each image, we will divide it into a 10x10 grid.\n3 random quadrats will be selected from each grid.\nThe size of all visible rocks will be measured in each quadrat.\nThe number of unique species in each quadrat will also be counted.\nWe will then calculate the average size of rocks and the average number of species for each image to minimise pseudoreplication.\nPossible confounding could arise from the presence of seaweed, which could affect the number of species present.\nIf the number of species is too high to count, we will group species into functional groups and count the number of functional groups instead.\n\nBackup plan:\n\nIf the assumptions of the linear model are not met, we will transform the data, otherwise we will attempt a non-linear model.",

    "text": "4 Exercise 2 – data entry\nIt is time to sample data from the images. While doing so, consider how you might minimise bias in your sampling. Also, if have not already done so, plan for time:\n\nHow long will it take to sample data from each image?\nHow many images will you sample from?\nHow many samples will you take from each image?\n\nEnter your data into a spreadsheet as soon as you have them. You can use any spreadsheet software you like (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers). Google Sheets is easiest if everyone in your group is sampling and entering data at the same time as it is easy to set up a shared spreadsheet, but you may also share the same computer and enter data one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDiscuss\n\n\n\nIf more than one person is entering data, will it influence the results? Why or why not? Think about how you can reduce the impact of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOptional: tidy your data\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make your life easier, recall the tidy data principles outlined in the workshop:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\nThe table below is tidy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "7 Fancy a challenge?\nA core part of BEDA is developing hands-on skills in experimental design by working with real data and organisms. This is your first opportunity to contribute to one of the available student-led projects. For one of the upcoming Module 2 projects, we plan to investigate the feeding preferences of the common garden snail (Helix aspersa).\n\nWe need your help!\nGary, our lab technical officer, will purchase about 300 commercially-raised snails for this experiment, but this is also a unique opportunity to see if wild-caught snails behave differently. If you have a backyard and are willing to do a little bit of exploring, your contribution would be a great help (and add a dimension) to students who choose to do this project.\nTo thank you for your help, we are offering a small reward for your efforts. We have a selection of free textbooks, gift cards, and coffee vouchers available for students who contribute snails to the project. Details on how to claim your reward will be provided in the next practical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSafety First!\n\n\n\nFor your safety and privacy, please only collect snails from your own backyard. Do not enter public parks after dark or go onto any private property that is not your own.\n\n\n\nWhat you will need\n\nA container with a secure lid (we can provide one). Poke small holes in the lid for air.\nGloves (if you prefer not to touch them) – we can provide these too.\nA torch (to find them at night).\nA piece of fruit or vegetable (like lettuce, carrot, or apple slices) to lure them out.\n\n\n\nHow to find snails\n\nBest time to look: Snails are nocturnal and love damp conditions. The best time to find them is at night (use a torch!), in the early morning, or just after it has rained.\nWhere to look: Check shady, damp spots. Look under rocks, logs, bricks, large leaves, and flowerpots. Compost heaps are also a snail paradise.\nHow to attract them: You can lure snails out! The night before your search, place a piece of fruit or vegetable (like lettuce, carrot, or apple slices) in a damp, sheltered spot. You can also lay a wooden plank or a piece of cardboard on the ground. Snails will often gather underneath it to stay moist.\n\n\n\nCollection & care\nWhen collecting snails, please handle them gently by picking them up carefully by their shells so you do not harm them. Place the snails in a container with some moist soil or a damp paper towel and a few leaves to make a comfortable temporary home. Add a small piece of lettuce or carrot for them to eat, and ensure the lid of the container has small holes for air so the snails can breathe. Keep the container in a cool, dark, and safe place until you are able to bring the snails to your next practical session.\n\n\nBringing them in\nPlease bring your snails to the lab next week. Your contribution will be a huge help. Thank you!",

Project Number: 2022/2148.\nYou may collect data for up to 10 visits per site over a 2 to 4 week period. For the bird survey, you may observe birds, count them and identify each to species if you can, using binoculars where needed. You may observe birds at a site for up to ~ one hour per visit, but must not interfere with nor handle the birds.\nAt a given site, the surveyor (1 to 5 students per site) will find a suitable location to observe birds. They will stand or sit still for 15 to 30 minutes per location and count the birds they can see in their site. They may need to move to up to five other locations per site if they have difficulty identifying the birds from afar. The number of each species will be recorded with reference to bird guides, and a total of about one hour will be spent at each site per observation period.\nDepending on your project, you may quantify other data, such as vegetation assessments and size of any habitat types including water bodies, at each site, enabling a test of the factors affecting bird abundance and species diversity.\nObservers will remain far enough from birds that the birds are not visibly affected by them (i.e. do not alter their behaviour, either by moving away or by altering what they are doing). This avoids any potential impact of the observer on time or energy budgets of the birds (as described in Bateman et al. 2011).\nReference: Bateman, P. W., and P. A. Fleming. 2011. Who are you looking at? Hadeda ibises use direction of gaze, head orientation and approach speed in their risk assessment of a potential predator. Journal of Zoology 285:316-323.\n\nConditions of bird project approval:\n\nYou must use the approved monitoring sheet “Bird survey monitoring sheet.xls” which will be provided to you. You may add additional columns or have additional sheets, as you decide, appropriate to your study.\nYou must take photos of the fieldwork sites and the observers watching the birds (i.e. to see the relative locations of the observers to the birds).\nBy the end of Week 9, you must post on Canvas:\n\nA complete legible copy of the final monitoring sheets from (1)\nA summary of the total number of (i) native birds, (ii) invasive birds hence (iii) all birds you counted at each site and across all sites over the course of your project, and a list of the sites you monitored, with GPS coordinates.\nClearly and informatively labelled photos from (2).\n\nInjured birds: In the very unlikely event that birds are found injured on site: you must:\n\nseek advice from Clare McArthur (clare.mcarthur@sydney.edu.au, subject heading: “BIOL2022 URGENT - bird project”) or other academic in the unit of study,\nwhile ensuring your own safety first, if necessary arrange to appropriately transport seriously injured animals to the nearest veterinarian for treatment, AND\nyou must notify Clare McArthur by email within 24h, summarising what has occurred (this will be reported as an adverse event to the Animal Ethics Committee even if you played no part in the injury).",

Groups will be released in your practical session. You will need to go to Canvas site for BIOL2022, select “People” in the sidebar and click on the “Report 1 Research Groups” tab. There, you will see project groups which you can “enrol” in. Make sure to check the Projects page for more information about each research project.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4 – Module 2 begins in the Lab\nSummary: Work with your group to discuss and plan your project. You will also be introduced to the pilot study—a small-scale version of your main experiment that you will run this week (or next). Pick up any gear that you need, to run your pilot study.\n\n\nIn your practical session\n\nForm your hypothesis: As a group, convert the general biological question into specific hypotheses and predictions.\nPlan the design of your main experiment: With your group, design a simple experiment to test your hypothesis. Ensure your design can be analysed using the statistical methods you are familiar with (e.g., from Januar’s and Clare’s lectures, and Module 1 practicals). Draw a graph of how you expect your data to look (refer to Clare’s lectures). Decide what statistical analysis is appropriate and why. If you can’t work this out, you are not ready to run your experiment.\nDraft your data sheets: As a group, draft your data sheets for data collection (you may need to modify these after your pilot study). This will ensure you collect all the necessary data, and do so consistently.\nWork out what equipment you’ll need: Decide what equipment you need for your research, based on what we can supply. Consult Clare, technical staff, and/or demonstrators, then make a list. For some projects, you will be able to take gear home straight away to run a pilot study. For others, you need to plan now and pick up gear in consultation with the technical staff. When contacting technical staff, ensure you state your name, day, group number, and project (e.g., BIOL2022 WED 2–4pm, Group 7 birds, Joe Blogs).\nPlan and run your pilot study: Plan your pilot study in class and run it before the Week 5 practical session. This will help you refine your main experiment. Everyone in your group must contribute.\n\n\n\nIn your own time\nAfter the prac in Week 4, contribute to your group’s pilot study practical work, read relevant literature, and start preparing for your written report.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5\nSummary: Finalise the design and plans for your main experiment based on your pilot study and your reading of the relevant scientific literature. Pick up any gear you need for your main experiment.\n\n\nIn your practical session\n\nDiscuss what you learned from your pilot study with your group.\nAdjust the design of your main experiment if needed: make any necessary changes to your plans, and finalise your experimental design.\nConfirm your statistical analysis: ensure you know how you will analyse your results, including identifying your response and explanatory variables, and selecting the appropriate statistical test.\n\n\n\nIn your own time\n\nSet up your main experiment, run it, collect and collate the data. Everyone in your group must contribute.\nCollate the data: collate your group’s data into one Excel file – e.g. using Google Sheets. Include both a metadata worksheet and a clean results array in its own worksheet for data analysis. You can also have other worksheets for anything you want to record, plot, etc. Finalise data collation before week 7 prac if you can, leaving you more time for data analysis in Week 7 prac.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6\nThere is no formal practical session in Week 6.\n\nIn your own time\nSet up your main experiment, run it, collect and collate the data. Everyone in your group must contribute.\n\n\n\nWeek 7\nSummary: Finalise collation of your main experiment data (including metadata). Begin analysing your main experiment data; aim to complete this if possible. Decide which plots and statistical outputs you will include in the results section of your written report.\n\n\nIn your practical session\nIf you have not already done so, finalise your data collation:\nSpend no more than 30 minutes of the practical session organising your data into an Excel spreadsheet. Preferably, complete this before the session.\nMetadata:\nInclude a metadata worksheet summarising key information about your data, such as:\n\nNames of group members\nDates the experiment was run\nSites where data were collected\nResponse (dependent) variables and their units of measurement\nExplanatory (independent) variables, such as treatments (and levels within each treatment) and any continuous variables\nAny other details to help interpret your project and data, e.g., explanations of column headings\n\nPlot, analyse, and interpret:\nDuring the remaining practical time (at least one hour), use your group’s dataset to individually learn how to use Excel and R or SPSS to plot your data, run appropriate statistical analyses, and interpret your results. Consider which statistical results you will need for the results section of your written report. Ideally, complete this task by the end of Week 7.\nNote: It is fine to work with other group members to plot and run analyses. However, each group member should perform the analyses themselves to learn; simply watching others is not sufficient.\n\n\nIn your own time\nSet up your main experiment, run it, collect and collate the data. Analyse and plot the data (the practicals also give you time to do this) if you have yet to complete it.\nDrafting your report: make a start on your report, e.g. framework for Introduction, Materials and Methods, and Results. You could leave the Discussion until you have finalised your Results. Refer to the following resources:\n\nClare’s tips on writing your report\nMore tips on writing your report\nModule 2: Marking scheme for project report\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8\nSummary: Clare will go through writing your report. Finalise analyses, stats output and graphs.\n\n\nIn your practical session\nAs a group: prepare your Excel data file for submission. The filename should be of the form Day-Time-Project, e.g. “WED2-4pmProj4A”. This file must include:\n\na metadata worksheet\na worksheet of the data array you will have imported to a stats package for analysis\nany other worksheets with workings, plots, etc.\n\nAs individuals: each group member needs to work on writing their report by:\n\ncompleting their own results and graphs\ndeciding what they will include in their individual report.\ndeciding how they will present the data and the associated statistics.\n\n\n\nIn your own time\n\nContinue your data analysis if you have yet to complete it.\nContinue drafting your report.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9\nSummary: Submit your group’s data and your written report in separate assignments in Canvas. There is a mid-semester break period where you may, if you wish, continue working on your project. However, Module 3 begins this week so you will not be able to work on your project in the practical sessions.\n\n\nIn your own time\n\nSubmission\nThere are two Canvas assignments for this assessment:\nReport 1 Group Data: one person from your group needs to submit the group’s data for this Canvas assignment\nReport 1: individual practical written report: each person in your group needs to submit their own report for this Canvas assignment.",

The ability to critically evaluate evidence is a fundamental life skill, and our aim is to help you build a strong foundation in it by helping you develop essential, hands-on skills in experimental design and analysis. We will move beyond theory and focus on the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of research:\n\nHow do you design a robust study from the ground up?\nWhy does your study’s design fundamentally shape its results?\nHow do you select the right statistical tools for your specific research question?\n\nThe skills you learn will be invaluable not just in biology, but in any future career path you choose.\nImportante note: We build upon foundational statistical concepts, so a basic understanding is assumed. If you need a refresher, please see: Am I ready for BEDA?\n\nUsing this handbook\nThis online handbook is your primary resource for BEDA. Use the sidebar to navigate through the content. We will walk you through its structure during our first week.  To get started, head over to Unit Information to learn about the course structure, assessments, and what to expect.\nBelow is a quick schedule of the unit, where you can find links to the lectures and practicals.",

Biol. 13. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619\n\nSTART EARLY, START EARLY, START EARLY: you can start to draft your introduction as early as Week 5, once you have read the literature on the topic and have a feel for what your experiment will cover. Don’t try to make it perfect – just get some words down. You can also start to draft your Materials and Methods section once you have started your experiment and before Week 7. You should be able to draft your result section after Week 7 and then finalise your whole report, including your discussion, in Week 8 and before submitting in Week 9.\nTitle: keep it brief, relevant, informative and interesting.\n\n5.1 Abstract\n\nBrief abstract (max. 120 words), including (1) background. (providing the context for your problem/project), (2) hypotheses or aims, (3) what you did, (4) what you found, (5) what it means, hence could be five sentences.\nDo NOT include references or details of statistical results (e.g. no F or P values).\n\n\n\n5.2 Introduction\n\nWhat do we know already? Make sure it leads logically to your aim(s). Provide the context - previous studies on the subject, using published (mainly) primary scientific literature, NOT websites. Integrate information clearly and concisely without loss of original meaning, to provide a logical, well-interpreted review of existing research and other information.\nAim of the experiment and biological hypotheses (IF…) and predictions (THEN…).\nWhy is the study important and/or interesting.\nStudy system – species, location of experiment (brief).\nDefinitions of scientific terms (if needed).\n\n\n\n5.3 Materials and Methods\n\nPilot study (if needed, keep it brief).\nSet-up of experiment.\nSampling design.\nData / variables recorded and how.\nStatistical analyses used, including which are dependent/independent variable(s) (if applicable), unit of replication, actual test(s) & why they are appropriate, statistical package(s).\n\n\n\n5.4 Results\n\nWritten statements describing results (data and stats). Refer to tables and figures as needed. Do NOT simply provide the tables and figures without supporting text.\nSummary presentation of data (no raw data) as tables, figures or in text as appropriate. Use tables for large amounts of data where detail is important, use figures to illustrate patterns. Indicate sample size and errors, and note whether the latter are standard errors or standard deviations… Format consistently. Make sure decimal places reflect your real capability to measure (e.g. can you really measure a 1 kg plant to 6 decimal places?)\nResults of statistical analyses presented either in text, on figures, or in tables.\n\nImportant tips:\n\nKnow what stats matter from the output – there are lots of them!\n\nOnly some/key stats need to be included in your report\nDo not copy and paste stats output from your stats package\nDO type the key stats results up yourself and only include what matters – that way we know you know what matters\n\nCheck assumptions if any are associated with your stats analysis:\n\nIn your Methods section of your report: say what/whether you have checked, whether they were met, if not, what did you do?\nin your report DO NOT present normality plots or plots of residuals\n\nPrepare your formal plot(s) for your report\n\nYou may present the plot produced by your stats package\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Discussion\n\nMain conclusions or findings\nInterpret results – what do they mean? How do they relate to original aims?\nCompare with and discuss in context of previously published work.\nEvery single study has some limitations to its approach or methods. This does NOT mean it is necessarily flawed. Take a positive approach to your research, given the usual constraints of ANY study, and if you do want to mention/discuss these constraints, do not reduce your discussion to a lengthy apology.\nFuture studies – what would you do next to extend our understanding of the subject and/or improve what you did? Keep this brief.\n\n\n\n5.6 General\n\nWrite in PLAIN English:\n\nBe succinct and avoid trying to sound “scientific”.\nread it out aloud, if it sounds pompous it is, and it should NOT be.\n\nCorrect presentation (format/length).\nReferences used and cited correctly. You are expected to use at least 10 relevant references from the primary literature.",

    "text": "6 More tips on writing your report\nThe following is a summary written by Clare’s Lab Group of PhD and Honours students after critically discussing two papers — not for content — but for how they were written.\n\n6.1 Structuring Research Papers: by Clare’s Lab Group\n“Rules” based on Mensh B, Kording K (2017) Ten simple rules for structuring papers. PLoS Comput Biol 13(9): e1005619. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619\n\n6.1.1 Papers discussed:\n\nCline, B. B. and Hunter, M. L. (2014), Different open‐canopy vegetation types affect matrix permeability for a dispersing forest amphibian. J Appl Ecol, 51: 319-329. doi:10.1111/1365-2664.12197\n\n\nPalmer, M. S., Fieberg, J. , Swanson, A. , Kosmala, M. and Packer, C. (2017), A ‘dynamic’ landscape of fear: prey responses to spatiotemporal variations in predation risk across the lunar cycle. Ecol Lett, 20: 1364-1373. doi:10.1111/ele.12832\n\n\n\n\n6.2 General notes\n\nDo write for your reader, do not write for yourself.\nIf you read the first sentence of every paragraph, it should tell a story.\nThe order of your ideas in each section should be the same; i.e. consistent order in intro, MM, R and probably D of your aims, methods for each aim (provided that works), results and discussion of your results associated with each aim.\nSubheadings can make sections easier to read and understand the flow of ideas.\nAvoid zigzagging ideas, i.e. you should never need to say “as mentioned above”.\nUse consistent wording – DO NOT use a variety of words to mean the same thing because it is confusing for readers. They will not know if you are referring to one thing or several. DO: pick one name for a variable and stick to it.\nTake the reader by the hand. DO NOT assume they know what you know. DO lead them through your work and explain things as you go along. Justify your decisions. Think like a reviewer: what will they want to know? Pre-empt it by being transparent, explaining what you decided to do and why.\n\n\n6.2.1 Introduction\n\nThere will generally be more references in the intro than the discussion. The focus of the intro is on: what do we know already?\nReferences are used to provide background of the research area – do not just list references on a topic. Instead, use them to summarise what we know and understand as a result of these studies. Make it clear what we know from (a) empirical evidence (with examples, i.e. do we know it for lots of individuals/species/contexts/ecosystems or whatever? which? Just one? which?) OR (b) what we think we know (conceptual hypotheses).\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Suggested Paragraph 1:\n\nIntroduce the broad topic.\nDescribe what research has been done on this topic.\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Suggested Paragraph 2:\n\nStart to narrow down what area in this topic your paper will be covering\n\nIntroduce gaps in knowledge.\nPossibly describe issues with previous studies (that your paper will address).\n\nThis information can show the importance of your paper.\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Suggested Paragraph 3 to 5:\n\nSpecifically describe what your paper will investigate.\nState your aims and hypotheses/predictions. These should follow and funnel down from your background. If you put your hand over your aims, you should be able to guess them from the background you provide above.\nBriefly describe how you investigated the topic.\nState any predictions with information to backup these predictions.\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Discussion\n\nThe focus is now on what you found, what it means and so how you have advanced our state of knowledge & understanding as a result of what you have done.\nTherefore: generally fewer references in the discussion than the introduction.\nReferences should be used to support your idea or relate your conclusions/results to previous studies.\nThe following paragraph order makes sense but you can obviously increase or decrease the number of paragraphs depending on the context and size of your study.\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Suggested Paragraph 1:\n\nState any broad results that you found.\nProvide evidence from your results that enabled you to come to that conclusion.\nCompare the result to any predictions you made or previous studies.\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Suggested Paragraph 2 to 4:\n\nState more detailed results (e.g. species specific results if dealing with multiple species).\nProvide evidence from your results that enabled you to come to that conclusion.\nCompare the result to any predictions made or previous studies.\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Suggested Paragraph 5:\n\nLimitations of your study\n\nNo study can answer everything and every study is limited in some way in what is achieves! Don’t worry! That’s life!\nDon’t dwell on this or go too much in depth – especially do not be apologetic.\nBe positive: just outline the boundaries of the conclusions that can be made with your results.\n\nSuggested direction of future studies i.e. what could be done next to move forward in our understanding and/or resolving any unanswered questions given what you have now discovered – again keep this brief.\n\n\n\n6.2.9 Suggested Paragraph 6:\n\nWhat are the implications of your study for your field of research\nDescribe what this information can affect or be used for (e.g. management decisions).\n\n\n\n6.2.10 Suggested Paragraph 7:\n\nYou do not need a concluding paragraph – but if you do, it is not just a summary.\nIt should be more big picture stuff but take care: it should not state something that could have been said whether or not you had done your study. It must rest on your study.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "BEDA is designed with the assumption that you have some prior experience with statistics from your first year of study. Most of you will have completed a unit like ENVX1002 or DATA1001, which provide a solid foundation in statistics. However, the only formal prerequisite for BEDA is the completion of at least one first-year science unit (see Enrolment Rules for details). We strongly encourage those of you who have not completed a first-year statistics unit to consider doing so before enrolling in BEDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you still choose to enrol in BEDA without prior statistics experience, please be aware that you will need to invest extra time and effort to catch up. BEDA is not designed to teach statistics from the ground up as this has already been covered in your first-year units!\n\n\n\nHow to gauge your readiness\nTo help you figure out if you’re ready for BEDA, we have put together a few questions on the key ideas you should already be familiar with so that you may self-assess yourself. Before you start this unit, you should be able to answer the following:\n\nExplain what a p-value is: What does a p-value actually mean? If you got a p-value of 0.03 from a biology experiment, what would you conclude?\nKnow your correlation: What’s the difference between positive and negative correlation? And why doesn’t correlation mean one thing causes another?\nTell data types apart: Can you explain the difference between continuous, discrete, and categorical data? Could you give an example of each?\nDescribe the ‘middle’ of your data i.e. central tendency: When would you use the mean instead of the median to talk about the centre of a dataset?\nUnderstand hypothesis testing: What are the main steps for testing a hypothesis? What do the null and alternative hypotheses do?\nUnderstand basic statistical tests: Can you remember what t-tests and simple linear regressions are for? Do you know what a ‘confidence interval’ or ‘standard error’ is telling you? It’s alright if you’re a bit rusty on these from first year, but could you get the gist with a quick recap?\n\nAs a general guide, if you can answer at least half of these questions, you should find the unit manageable.\nThe first few weeks of BEDA will briefly cover these concepts but we won’t be teaching them from scratch. If you’re not familiar with these topics we strongly suggest you review them before the unit starts, either by using online resources or by reading an introductory statistics textbook. We’ve recommended two that are available in the Library (and linked) below:\n\nExperimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists by Quinn and Keough\nBiometry: the principles and practice of statistics in biological research by Sokal and Rohlf",

    "text": "1. A GLM with a continuous predictor\nLet’s examine the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and its flipper length. We begin by thinking about how these two variables might be related and construct the model. Words are fine as the GLM will work out the details once the model is fitted!\n\nBody mass is likely to be related to flipper length. We should be able to use flipper length to predict body mass.\n\n\\[\n\\text{body\\_mass\\_g} \\sim \\text{flipper\\_length\\_mm}\n\\]\n\n\nImagine if flipper length were categorical (e.g., short, medium, long). We could still model the relationship with body mass, but the approach would change. We will need to use “dummy variables” to represent the categories and then determine the differences in body mass between these categories. This is explained in Lecture 3b when there are just two categories, and in Lecture 4b next week for more than two categories.\nThe data types for our variables are as follows:\n\nbody_mass_g: Continuous numeric\nflipper_length_mm: Continuous numeric\n\nSince we are fitting a continuous outcome variable (body_mass_g) with a continuous predictor (flipper_length_mm), our general linear model will look at how body mass changes with flipper length.\n\nChecking assumptions with diagnostic plots\nWe can generate a set of standard diagnostic plots in R, Jamovi and most other statistical software packages when we fit a generalised linear model. For example, below is an output in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagnostic plots for the linear model of penguin flipper length predicted by body mass. The plots are produced in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the plots\n\nResiduals vs Fitted: Checks for linearity. Points should be randomly scattered around zero. A curved pattern means the relationship may not be linear. Here, the scatter looks random, so linearity is fine.\nNormal Q-Q: Checks if residuals are normally distributed. Points should follow the dashed line. Ours do, so normality is met.\nScale-Location: Checks for equal variance. Points should be evenly spread, and the red line should be flat. Our plot shows consistent spread, so variance is fine.\nResiduals vs Leverage: Identifies influential points. Points outside the red dashed lines are influential. We have none, so no concerns.\n\nIn Jamovi, no specific module is necessary to perform a simple linear regression, so we can use the built-in regression tool to fit the model and check the assumptions. Importantly, there are fewer options to assess the assumptions compared to R, but this does not necessarily mean that the checks are less rigorous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQQ-plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals vs Fitted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Diagnostic plots for the linear model of penguin flipper length predicted by body mass.

    "text": "4 Exercise 2 – Introduction to models in statistics\n\nWhat is the point?\nOne of the most important parts of study design is being able to model data. One way to do this is with plots – they are not just pretty pictures, but actually capture the heart of your study design. In this exercise, you will get to grips with what a model is and how it helps you plan and analyse experiments.\n\nWhat is a model?\nA model is just a simple way to represent something complicated. In data analysis, a model helps us make sense of a dataset, test ideas (hypotheses), or make predictions. Models can be as simple or as fancy as you like, depending on your data and your research question.\nSoon, you will be using what is called an empirical model. It might look like a scary equation, but you do not need to be a maths genius to get the idea.\nHere is an example:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\]\nThis just means: “the value of \\(y\\) is equal to a constant, plus \\(x_1\\) times another constant, plus a bit of random error.”\nBut we can make it even simpler by thinking of it as a relationship:\n\\[y \\sim x_1\\]\nThis means: “\\(y\\) is influenced by \\(x_1\\).”\nSo if \\(y\\) is weight and \\(x_1\\) is age, it is:\n\\[\\text{weight} \\sim \\text{age}\\]\nIn other words, “weight depends on age.”\n\n\nIf you can plot it, you are already modelling it!\nFor now, let us focus on graphical models – in other words, plots! Plots are models because they show relationships between variables. For example, you could plot the weight of an animal species against its age or height to see if there is a pattern:\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(328)\n\nWeight &lt;- c(rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 3), rnorm(50, mean = 60, sd = 3))\nAge &lt;- c(rep(\"Young\", 50), rep(\"Old\", 50))\n\n\n# create data frame\ndata &lt;- data.frame(Weight, Age)\n\n# ggplot\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data, aes(x = Age, y = Weight)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Young\", \"Old\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Weight vs Age of an animal species. Simulated data. Here, age is a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, how we consider your variables can drastically change the type of plot and model used for data analysis. For example, consider the same relationship as above, but plotted differently:\n\n\nCode\nV_max &lt;- 70 # Assume the maximum weight is 70 kg\nK_M &lt;- 10 # Assume the Michaelis constant is 10 years\n\n# Generate age data\nage &lt;- seq(1, 20, by = 0.5) # From 1 to 20 years, in 0.5 year increments\n\n# Apply the Michaelis-Menten equation to simulate weight data\nweight &lt;- V_max * age / (K_M + age) + rnorm(length(age), mean = 0, sd = 5)\n\n# Create a data frame\ndata &lt;- data.frame(Age = age, Weight = weight)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data, aes(x = Age, y = Weight)) +\n  geom_point() + # Use geom_line for continuous data\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Weight vs Age of an animal species. Simulated data. Here, age is a continuous variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how both plots show the same kind of relationship, but the way we interpret them – and the type of model we use – is different. This is what study design and data analysis are all about: the model you choose can totally change your results, so planning ahead is key!\n\n\n\nGet ready\n\nMS Excel (or similar) to look at the data files\nWord, Google Docs, or just pen and paper to sketch your models\nR, Jamovi, SPSS, or any software you fancy for plotting\nData: penguins.csv and possums.xlsx (grab them from Canvas)\n\n\n\nYour task\nYour goal is to practise thinking like a research biologist. For this, you will choose a dataset, use that variables to formulate a research question, and sketch a graphical model to help answer your question. Remember, you do not need to analyse or process any data for this task. Simply knowing the type of variables you are working with (e.g., categorical, continuous) is enough to decide on and sketch an appropriate plot.\n\nExplore the data. Download penguins.csv and possums.xlsx. Open them and familiarise yourself with the variables available in each dataset.\nFormulate a research question and choose a model. Pick one of the datasets and think of a simple research question you could ask. Then, decide which type of plot would be the best way to visualise the answer. Here are some common plots and what they show:\n\nHistogram: Shows the distribution of a single continuous variable. Useful for seeing the shape of your data (e.g., is it symmetrical or skewed?).\nScatterplot: Shows the relationship between two continuous variables. Ideal for spotting trends, patterns, or correlations.\nBoxplot: Compares the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories. Excellent for comparing groups.\nBarplot: Compares a summary statistic (like a mean or count) across different categories. Use it when you want to show the size of different groups.\n\nSketch your model and write down your question. In your new lab notebook, write down your research question clearly. Beneath it, sketch the plot that represents your model. For example, if your question is “How does possum weight differ between sexes?”, a boxplot would be a suitable model.\nThink about your model. Consider the variables you have chosen. Why is your chosen plot suitable? Could you use a different plot if you collected the data differently? Discuss your ideas with your peers or your demonstrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the possum data in Excel. Let’s think about how the weight of a possum changes with age.\nWhat kind of variables are these? Are they continuous, categorical, or something else? With that in mind, sketch the plot(s) you think will help you understand the data. Weight is continuous and age is categorical, so a boxplot is a good start.\nWhat if you collected age in years instead of categories? Then you could use a scatterplot. But maybe you can’t tell a possum’s exact age, so that might not be practical.\nThe first model would probably use a two-sample t-test, while the second could use linear regression.\n\nA model comparing the weights of juvenile and adult possums could be shown as a boxplot or barplot. Here’s a boxplot of the possum data:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\npossums &lt;- read_excel(\"assets/possums.xlsx\", sheet = 2)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(possums, aes(x = Age, y = BW)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how thinking about how to interpret the data is a big part of study design? It helps you decide what data to collect and how to analyse it. But notice – there is only one juvenile possum in the dataset, so you could not really analyse this properly!\nFood for thought: Can age still be used to construct a model given that there is only one juvenile possum?",

Keep “Data Type” as Sample Data. Clear button “Title”.\nCheck to ensure you have the correct number of rows and columns and all looks well.\nGo to Edit, go to Factors, go to Add and name your new factor(s) appropriately, code each site for that factor and press OK.\nGo to Pre-treatment and then to Transform (overall), and select an appropriate transformation for your data. (4th root or presence/absence, etc1.)\nTo make an nMDS plot: Go to Analyse then Resemblance and click ‘analyse between samples’ and ‘Bray-Curtis similarity’. Go to Analyse then to Non-metric MDS, change number of restarts to 20 and select configuration plot. You can modify how the nMDS plot is displayed by right clicking on the figure.\nTo perform a PERMANOVA you need to firstly create a PERMANOVA design, and then run the PERMANOVA you have designed\n\nTo create a PERMANOVA design: Return to the resemblance matrix. Go to PERMANOVA+ then Create PERMANOVA design. Create a title for the design and select appropriate number of factors. Enter in each factor you want to incorporate into the design, and code as either fixed or random factor. Complex designs can be created at this point.\nTo run the PERMANOVA: Return to the resemblance matrix. Go to PERMANOVA+ then PERMANOVA. Select the correct design (usually the highest number). Select Mains test and your permutational method (reduced model is usually fine), the sum of squares type (type III) and the number of permutations (999 recommended) then OK.\n\nInterpret the PERMANOVA output. If one or more of your factors are significant, then you run the PERMANOVA design again, selecting Pair-wise test and select the factor/interaction of interest. Press OK.\nIf appropriate, return to transformed data set and go to Analyse and then SIMPER. Select appropriate factor and click OK.\nSave result(s) to a file.\n\n\n\n4.2 ANOSIM\nAs an alternative to PERMANOVA, many studies will test differences between treatments using Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM). Unlike PERMANOVA which can be used for multi-factorial designs, ANOSIM is best used for simple one-factor analyses. PERMANOVA and ANOSIM will generate the same (or very similar results) for one-factor analyses.\n\n4.2.1 To perform an ANOSIM\nReturn to resemblance matrix, go to Analyse then to ANOSIM, select appropriate factor which you added before.\nSignificance level in % in ANOSIM becomes probability if divided by 100. e.g. 0.2 ÷ 100 = 0.002 = P (in this case P &lt; 0.05). If ‘Significance level of sample statistic’ in ‘Global Test’ section of the output is more than 5 (which is &gt; 0.05), than there is no significant difference among any of the treatments even if ‘Pairwise Tests’ section has significant differences between pairs of particular treatments. ANOSIM results are presented as: (P = 0.076, Global R = 0.148, 999 permutations) where P is a global significance level.",

Different analytical software requires slightly different formats but there are usually some generalities that apply across programs.\nFor the start of next week’s practical each group will need to have collated their group data into three spreadsheets; These spreadsheets will be marked out of 5 by demonstrators.\n\nHabitat data: an SPSS or R ready excel file with sites as rows and habitat variables as columns (see below)\nAssemblage/Community data: a PRIMER or R ready excel file with species ID as rows and sites as columns (see below)\nSummary statistics: additional excel files as above (1 and 2) but with summary statistics (numbers of spp., individuals, habitat variables etc.) calculated for your data. This may be done on a site specific or treatment specific basis depending on your question.\n\n\n5.1 1. Your habitat data for PCA\nHabitat data – You will need to enter your data on habitat characteristics into SPSS or R for analysis next week. Make sure you are familiar with how to organise it for SPSS. Every site needs its own row where every habitat variable measured is listed, i.e. every site assessment has an independent row. If you have treatments you need to include a column labeling those treatments too (in addition to “site name”).\n\n\n5.2 2. Organising and entering assemblage data for PRIMER\nAssemblage/Community data – You will need to generate your spp*site matrix into a PRIMER ready file so that we are ready to analyse your data at the labs next week. These will take the form of a spreadsheet with a single column identifying species (unique species identifiers are fine) with the abundances for each site in rows (page 22). This sheet must start in the top left cell of that worksheet with only a single row of column labels. Make sure that you keep a reference file where you have recorded the specific identity of the unique species identifiers (e.g. A= Toyota Corolla, B= Leyland P76 etc.).\n\n\n5.3 3. Generating summary statistics for additional (univariate) analyses\nOn an additional spreadsheet/workspace, you should calculate summary statistics to perform additional univariate analyses. Create a copy of your completed excel file and or worksheet. You should generate a column in the far right of your spreadsheet summing the number of things in each row. You can then sort the data (REMEMBER TO SELECT IT ALL!) by that column and delete all the zero rows (i.e. no evidence of that species in your system).\nOwing to the high degree of variation and the number of singletons you will encounter it is possible (and likely) that some groups will pool species into more coarse groupings (i.e. “genera” or “family”).\nThe easiest way to calculate some of these summary statistics will be to use the pivot table command in Excel to sort your data for you. To do this:\n\nHighlight the dataset you want to use\nChoose Pivot Table from the Data menu\nWork through the wizard creating a pivot table in a new worksheet\nThen change the drop down menu in the box to “to data area” and click on the different sites to add them.\n\nYou should have a functional summary pivot table of your data. You can change the pivot tables to look at “counts” (equivalent of presence absence data) or “sums” (abundance data) for your spreadsheet.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of data sheet for importing data into SPSS for PCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of data sheet for importing data into PRIMER",

    "text": "2 Part 1: Principal components analysis – “perceptions of biology lecturers”\nYou will use PCA to reduce your set of measured variables into a coherent smaller dataset. In addition, you will be comparing your lecturer perceptions between preferred systems (marine, freshwater or terrestrial), preferred taxon (animals or plants) and gender (male or female) using conventional univariate approaches (t-tests/ANOVAs). To perform these univariate approaches, make sure that you not only create the principal components (PCs) but also save the scores (see below) for each component.\nThe process in JAMOVI is listed below. R instructions are given on Canvas in an R script file.\n\nImport your data. Download it here. If the link does not work, please go on to Canvas. A new Module 3 Resurces link has been added to the front page.\n\nOpen Jamovi.\nGo to the top-left menu (☰) → click Open → Browse and select your Excel/csv file (e.g. your lecturer dataset).\nOnce imported, check that all the columns (variables) are correctly recognised as numeric (look for a ruler icon in the column headers).\nYou may convert columns of interest to numeric in several ways. One way is to use the Variables tab to select all the variables of interest (use Shift+click or Ctrl+click), then click on Edit and change “Measure Type” to “Continuous”.\n\n\nVideo\n\nRun Principal Components Analysis\n\nClick on the “Factor” tab in the top toolbar.\nSelect Principal Component Analysis.\n\nSelect your variables\n\nIn the *new section, from the panel on the left, select the variables of interest and move them into the “Variables” box.\nYou can do this by either clicking on the arrow button or by dragging and dropping them.\n\n\nVideo\n\nMethod and assumption checks\n\nUnder the “Methods” section, set Rotation to “Varimax” (this is the most common rotation method).\nTick the box for Bartlett’s test of sphericity (to check if your data is suitable for PCA) in Assumption checks.\n\nNumber of components\n\nSelect “Based on eigenvalue”.\nThe default is to retain components with eigenvalues &gt; 1 (Kaiser’s criterion). Change that if you have a specific reason to do so.\n\nAdditional Output\n\nSelect all of the options in this section. These will provide you with useful information to interpret your PCA results.\n\n\nVideo\n\nSave component scores\n\nTick “Save component scores to data set” (usually found under the Scores section at the bottom).\nThis will add new variables to your dataset representing each component.\nYou can view the new variables by clicking on the Data tab at the top of the screen and scrolling to the right.\n\n\n\nAfter PCA: Review Your Output\n\nScree Plot: Helps determine how many components to retain.\nSaved Scores: You can now use these component scores in further analyses (e.g., regression or cluster analysis).\nBartlett’s Test of Sphericity tests whether your correlation matrix is significantly different from an identity matrix—a matrix where all off-diagonal values are zero (no correlation between variables), and all diagonal values are one (each variable only correlates with itself). Bartlett’s Test should be significant (p &lt; .05): a significant result means that your correlation matrix is not an identity matrix, and PCA can be used.\n\nThat said, this test is most useful when used alongside visual inspection of your correlation matrix. If many variables aren’t correlated with others, they may not contribute much to PCA and could be removed.\n\n\nInterpreting the PCA\nYou need to:\n\nLook at the correlation matrix.\nExamine the scree plot and determine how many PCs you can identify (eigenvalues &gt;1, Kaiser’s Criterion).\nEstablish a meaningful name for each component based on the loadings for individual variables in the rotated solutions.\n\n\n\nAfter the PCA\nExamine whether gender, system biases (marine v. terrestrial) and taxon (animal v. plant) biases may affect the perceptions of biology lecturers. You will need to code the columns for each factor (i.e. males = 0, females = 1) for Jamovi to perform its standard one-way ANOVAs or t-tests.\nQuestions to consider:\n\nDo males and females perceive lecturer qualities the same way?\nDo botanists and zoologists perceive lecturer qualities the same way?\nDo marine and terrestrial folk perceive lecturer qualities the same way?",

    "text": "3 Part 2: Designing your multivariate experiment\n\nThe data and your model system\nBiologists are increasingly turning to multivariate approaches because the questions we ask—and the data we collect—are often inherently multivariate. This is especially true when studying both biotic assemblages and abiotic habitat variables.\nTo explore these analytical techniques, you will work in groups to generate your own multivariate datasets using non-biological model systems. Examples include:\n\nCars and the car parks they inhabit\nGargoyles and the buildings they reside on\nBeer types and the drinking establishments in which they appear\n\nThese creative analogues allow you to test and visualise multivariate patterns in a controlled and accessible way.\nExample: Cars as a Model System\n\nCars have been successfully used as a teaching model for ecological analysis (e.g., Gaston et al. 1993). In this context:\nDifferent car types can be treated as “species”.\nDifferent suburbs or locations represent “sites”.\nThe car park characteristics (e.g., size, surface, signage) act as “habitat variables”.\n\nA sample proforma will be provided to illustrate how such a system can be structured to generate a multivariate dataset with testable hypotheses. See the Module 3 Resources section on Canvas to download the template.\n\n\nGroup work\nAs a group, you will:\n\nDesign your own non-biological multivariate model system.\nDevelop 2–3 testable hypotheses relating to:\n\nThe assemblages of “species” across different treatments (e.g., locations, types of environments),\nThe role of measured “habitat variables” in shaping those assemblages.\n\nUse a two-factor design where possible (e.g., site × time, or suburb × establishment type).\nEnsure adequate replication—you will need at least 3 replicates per treatment.\nDesign a sampling strategy that allows you to collect the required data.\nAssign a data coordinator within your group to manage dataset preparation.",

    "text": "Early Feedback Task (EFT) - 5%\n\nDue: 29 August 2025\nThis is a short quiz, designed to give you early feedback on your prior understanding of statistics. It will help you identify areas where you may need to focus your study efforts.\n\nDue in: \n\nDetails Submission link\n\n\n\n Evaluation Quiz (Module 1) - 10%\n\nDue: 5 September 2025\nThis is a quiz that covers key ideas about statistics and how experiments are set up based on Module 1. The higher score of two attempts will be recorded, so you can learn from the feedback instead of being penalised for them. More importantly, we hope that you use this quiz as a means of reflection, rather than a test of your knowledge.\n\nDue in: \n\nDetails Submission link\n\n\n\n Report 1 (Module 2) - 25%\n\nDue: 7 October 2025\nYou will use what you have learned so far to design and analyse an experiment based on a project of your choice. The experiments will be completed in groups, but the reports are individually written and assessed. You will have 6 weeks to complete it.\nRole of Practicals:\nPracticals are designed to be flexible and student-driven. Rather than following a set procedure, you are encouraged to use practical sessions to seek feedback on your project ideas, experimental design, and analysis plans. Demonstrators act as advisors, similar to how support works in a research group, and you are welcome to interact with them and your peers for advice, just as you would with postdocs or supervisors. If you are organised, you can also request feedback on your report drafts during practicals to help improve your work.\n\nReport due: \n\nDetails Data submission Report submission\n\n\n\n Report 2 (Module 3) - 20%\n\nDue: 20 October 2025 (dataset submission) | 7 November 2025 (report)\nReport 2 is similar to Report 1, but you will need to focus on a project with a multivariate context. Note that there is a 5% group work component to this report that will be assessed via dataset submission, and the report is individually written and assessed (15%). You will have 5 weeks to complete the report.\nRole of Practicals:\nPracticals are a mix of structured and unstructured sessions. Each practical begins with a brief workshop to practice a specific analysis technique, followed by time for you to work on your project. Some practicals are dedicated feedback sessions, for example we will prioritise giving feedback on your experimental design and analysis plans in Week 10. As usual, you are welcome to interact with demonstrators and your peers for advice and feedback.\n\nDataset submission:  Report due: \n\nDetails Submission link",
