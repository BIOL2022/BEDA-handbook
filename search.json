    "text": "Many students think of BEDA as yet another statistics unit. This is not quite true. Unlike most other statistical units, BEDA focuses on the practical aspects of data analysis. We assume that you already have a basic understanding of statistical concepts, and we build on that knowledge, focusing on the how and why of statistical methods:\n\nHow do we design a good study?\nWhy does study design make a difference in the results we get?\nWhy is it important to understand the context in which we use statistical tests?\n\nImportantly, attending labs is crucial to your learning as most of the data we use are collected by you ‚Äì please do not skip any of them!"
