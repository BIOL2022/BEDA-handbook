## Introduction {.unlisted}

Thank you for joining BIOL202 Biology Experimental Design and Analysis, known to many as **BEDA (üêù-da)**. The ability to critically evaluate evidence is a fundamental life skill, and our aim is to help you build a strong foundation in it by helping you develop essential, hands-on skills in experimental design and analysis. We will move beyond theory and focus on the 'how' and 'why' of research:

- *How* do you design a robust study from the ground up?
- *Why* does your study's design fundamentally shape its results?
- *How* do you select the right statistical tools for your specific research question?

The skills you learn will be invaluable not just in biology, but in any future career path you choose. 

**Importante note: We build upon foundational statistical concepts, so a basic understanding is assumed.** If you need a refresher, please see: [Am I ready for BEDA?](prerequisites.qmd)


### Using this handbook {.unlisted}


This online handbook is your primary resource for BEDA. Use the sidebar to navigate through the content. We will walk you through its structure during our first week. 
<!-- A simplified [<i class=" bi bi-file-text"></i> PDF version](assets/BEDA-handbook.pdf) is also available for offline use, and printed copies will be provided during practicals for quick reference. -->
To get started, head over to [Unit Information](unit-information.qmd) to learn about the course structure, assessments, and what to expect.
