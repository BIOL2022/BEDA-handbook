## Welcome!

> *BEDA is the Unit of Study I wish had been available to me as an undergraduate. My goal is to create and share that experience with you.*  
> ‚Äî **Januar**


Thank you for joining BIOL202 Biology Experimental Design and Analysis, also known as **BEDA (üêù-da)**. This unit is a second-year core Biology unit taught at the University of Sydney and is designed to help you develop essential skills in biology, focusing on how research is planned, analysed, and understood. Unlike most statistics courses, BEDA emphasises the **practical/applied** side of data analysis. We expect you [already know the basics of statistics](#) so we concentrate on the **how** and **why** behind statistical methods:

- *How* do we design a strong study?
- *Why* does the design of a study affect the results?
- *Why* is it important to consider the context when choosing statistical tests?

### Is this unit for me?

**The ability to think critically about information that is presented to you and evidence is a *fundamental* skill in life itself, and our aim is to help you build a strong foundation in it.**

BEDA has been designed to give you the hands-on skills that will be valuable throughout your career. While our examples are drawn from biology, the skills in experimental design and analysis are *universal* as you assess information, evaluate evidence, and make decisions in your future roles -- whether you become a biologist, a veterinarian, a medical professional, or an engineer. 

Importantly, you will realise that BEDA is not just about learning statistics. It is about **learning how to think critically** about information and how to evaluate evidence. The statistical software and methods are just tools to help you achieve this goal. We do not focus on any one software package, and you are free to use whichever software you prefer (we are software-agnostic!). Our main aim is to help you understand how to approach problems and make sense of data.

### Using this handbook

If you are reading this handbook online, you can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to different sections. **A PDF version of this handbook exists, but it is not the primary version and is only intended to be used as a reference during practicals.** We will share printed copies of the PDF version during practicals.
