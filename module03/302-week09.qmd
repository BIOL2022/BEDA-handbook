- Be familiar with the concepts behind **multivariate hypothesis testing** using permutational techniques such as **ANOSIM** and **PERMANOVA**
- Be able to **plan and conduct experiments** that test multivariate hypotheses
- Know how to **carry out these analyses using relevant statistical software**
- Be able to **interpret, present, and report** your findings clearly and effectively

:::

In this specific practical you will:

- [ ] Use **PCA** to analyse “lecturer perceptions” data gathered in previous years
- [ ] In groups, design an investigation using a model system to test a multivariate hypothesis for your upcoming report

### Analyses covered in practical 1

**Principal Components Analysis (PCA)** is a technique used to **reduce the dimensionality** of a dataset by extracting a smaller set of **new variables (principal components)** that capture as much of the **variance** in the original data as possible. These components summarise complex patterns across multiple variables, making the data easier to visualise and interpret.

## Part 1: Principal components analysis – “perceptions of biology lecturers”

You will use PCA to reduce your set of measured variables into a coherent smaller dataset. In addition, you will be comparing your lecturer perceptions between preferred systems (marine, freshwater or terrestrial), preferred taxon (animals or plants) and gender (male or female) using conventional univariate approaches (t-tests/ANOVAs). To perform these univariate approaches, make sure that you not only create the principal components (PCs) but also save the scores (see below) for each component. 

**The process in JAMOVI is listed below. R instructions are given on Canvas in an R script file.**

1. Import your data. [**Download it here**](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/67437/pages/module-3-resources). If the link does not work, please go on to [Canvas](). A new **Module 3 Resurces** link has been added to the front page.
   - Open **Jamovi**.
   - Go to the top-left menu (☰) → click **Open** → **Browse** and select your Excel/csv file (e.g. your lecturer dataset).
   - Once imported, check that all the columns (variables) are correctly recognised as numeric (look for a ruler icon in the column headers).
   - You may convert columns of interest to numeric in several ways. One way is to use the **Variables** tab to select all the variables of interest (use Shift+click or Ctrl+click), then click on Edit and change "**Measure Type**" to "**Continuous**".

2. Run Principal Components Analysis
   - Click on the **“Factor”** tab in the top toolbar.
   - Select **Principal Component Analysis**.

3. Select your variables
   - In the *new section, from the panel on the left, select the variables of interest and move them into the **“Variables”** box. 
   - You can do this by either clicking on the arrow button or by dragging and dropping them.

4. Method and assumption checks
   - Under the **“Methods”** section, set Rotation to "Varimax" (this is the most common rotation method).
   - Tick the box for **Bartlett’s test of sphericity** (to check if your data is suitable for PCA) in **Assumption checks**.

5. Number of components
   - Select "**Based on eigenvalue**".
   - The default is to retain components with eigenvalues **> 1** (Kaiser’s criterion). Change that if you have a specific reason to do so.

6. Additional Output
   - **Select all of the options in this section.** These will provide you with useful information to interpret your PCA results.

7. Save component scores
   - Tick “Save component scores to data set” (usually found under the Scores section at the bottom).
   - This will add new variables to your dataset representing each component.
   - You can view the new variables by clicking on the **Data** tab at the top of the screen and scrolling to the right.


#### After PCA: Review Your Output

- **Scree Plot**: Helps determine how many components to retain.
- **Saved Scores**: You can now use these component scores in further analyses (e.g., regression or cluster analysis).
- **Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity** tests whether your correlation matrix is significantly different from an identity matrix—a matrix where all off-diagonal values are zero (no correlation between variables), and all diagonal values are one (each variable only correlates with itself). Bartlett’s Test should be significant (p < .05): a **significant result** means that your correlation matrix is not an identity matrix, and PCA ***can*** be used.

That said, this test is most useful when used **alongside visual inspection** of your correlation matrix. If many variables aren’t correlated with others, they may not contribute much to PCA and could be removed.

#### Interpreting the PCA

You need to:

- Look at the correlation matrix.
- Examine the scree plot and determine how many PCs you can identify (eigenvalues >1, Kaiser’s Criterion).
- Establish a meaningful name for each component based on the loadings for individual variables in the rotated solutions.

#### After the PCA

Examine whether gender, system biases (marine v. terrestrial) and taxon (animal v. plant) biases may affect the perceptions of biology lecturers. You will need to code the columns for each factor (i.e. males = 0, females = 1) for Jamovi to perform its standard one-way ANOVAs or t-tests.

Questions to consider:

- Do males and females perceive lecturer qualities the same way?
- Do botanists and zoologists perceive lecturer qualities the same way?
- Do marine and terrestrial folk perceive lecturer qualities the same way?

## Part 2: Designing your multivariate experiment

##### The data and your model system

Biologists are increasingly turning to **multivariate approaches** because the questions we ask—and the data we collect—are often inherently multivariate. This is especially true when studying both biotic **assemblages** and **abiotic habitat variables**.

To explore these analytical techniques, you will work in groups to generate your own multivariate datasets using **non-biological model systems**. Examples include:

- **Cars** and the **car parks** they inhabit
- **Gargoyles** and the **buildings** they reside on
- **Beer types** and the **drinking establishments** in which they appear

These creative analogues allow you to test and visualise multivariate patterns in a controlled and accessible way.

Example: Cars as a Model System

- Cars have been successfully used as a teaching model for ecological analysis (e.g., Gaston et al. 1993). In this context:
- Different car types can be treated as "species".
- Different suburbs or locations represent "sites".
- The car park characteristics (e.g., size, surface, signage) act as "habitat variables".

A sample proforma will be provided to illustrate how such a system can be structured to generate a multivariate dataset with testable hypotheses. See the [Module 3 Resources](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/67437/pages/module-3-resources) section on Canvas to download the template.


##### Group work

As a group, you will:

- Design your own non-biological multivariate model system.
- Develop 2–3 testable hypotheses relating to:
  - The assemblages of "species" across different treatments (e.g., locations, types of environments),
  - The role of measured "habitat variables" in shaping those assemblages.
- Use a two-factor design where possible (e.g., site × time, or suburb × establishment type).
- Ensure adequate replication—you will need at least 3 replicates per treatment.
- Design a sampling strategy that allows you to collect the required data.
- Assign a data coordinator within your group to manage dataset preparation.

## Week 11 group presentation (compulsory)

During the Week 11 practical session (Week 2 of the prac series), your group will deliver a brief presentation (<5 minutes) using a PowerPoint to introduce your project.

This session is compulsory and designed to provide constructive feedback before you begin data collection. Don’t worry—feedback is friendly and intended to improve your design, not critique your creativity!

Your presentation should include:

- An introduction to your system (model species and treatments)
- Your 2–3 hypotheses
- A description of your taxonomy (how you're classifying your “species”)
- Your sampling design, including sample size and sampling effort
- A list of habitat variables you will measure at each site (and how you will measure them)
- A simple map of your sites

## Assessment overview

To give you the maximum opportunity to analyse your data and understand your results, your group’s dataset will be checked during Week 11 by demonstrators.

### Group data submission (5%)

- This is a group assessment: only one group member needs to upload the data file (Excel format) to Canvas on behalf of the group.
- The dataset must be submitted before your Week 11 practical session.
- It is worth 5% of your total unit mark.
- Near-perfect datasets that are well-organised, correctly formatted, and ready for analysis will receive the full 5%.
- As this is a group submission, Special Consideration, Simple Extensions, and Academic Plans do not apply.

### Individual report (15%)

Each student will submit an individual short report, focusing primarily on the Methods and Results sections, as outlined in the attached marking rubric.

- The report must include:
  - A brief Introduction with clearly stated hypotheses
  - A detailed Methods section, describing your data collection and analyses

## Report submission details

Your individual report is due by 12:59 pm on the Sunday before STUVAC. Please ensure it is submitted electronically and anonymously via Canvas .

We aim to return reports with summative feedback approximately one week after submission.

### Academic integrity

You are expected to complete your report independently and uphold the principles of academic honesty.

- Plagiarism or copying from others will result in loss of marks and may lead to further disciplinary action.
- Refer to the University’s policies on academic integrity: [Academic Integrity at the University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/academic-integrity.html)

### Use of ChatGPT or similar tools

- You may use tools like ChatGPT to check grammar or assist with R coding.
- However, extensive use of AI to write your report will be detectable and penalised. We are looking for your own scientific reasoning and interpretation.

### Report Format

Your report should follow the format of a short scientific article suitable for submission to Austral Ecology. The “Notice to Contributors” is available at: [Austral Ecology – Author Guidelines](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14429993/homepage/ForAuthors.html)
