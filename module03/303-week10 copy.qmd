## 🗺️ The Big Picture: What Are We Doing?

Think of your ecological data as a puzzle. You've counted species at different sites, but how do you make sense of it all? 

**Today you'll learn to:**

1. **See patterns** → Using ordination plots (nMDS) to visualise which sites are similar
2. **Test differences** → Using statistics (PERMANOVA/ANOSIM) to prove groups are different  
3. **Find causes** → Using SIMPER to identify which species make sites different

:::{.callout-important}
## Don't Panic! 
This looks like a lot, but you'll work through it step by step. The software does the heavy lifting—you just need to understand what to click and what the results mean.

## 📚 Understanding the Methods (Read This First!)

Before diving into button-clicking, let's understand what these tools actually do. **Don't memorise everything**—just get the gist, then refer back when needed.

### The Three Tools in Your Toolkit

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
**🔵 nMDS**  
*"The Mapper"*

Creates a visual map showing which sites have similar communities
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
**🟢 PERMANOVA**  
*"The Tester"*

Tests if groups are genuinely different (not just by chance)
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
**🟠 SIMPER**  
*"The Detective"*

Reveals which species are responsible for the differences
:::
::::

---

### 🔵 nMDS: Making Sense of Messy Data

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What is nMDS? (Click to expand)

**nMDS = Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling**

**In plain English:** Imagine you have 50 species at 20 sites. That's too much information to visualise! nMDS squashes all that complexity into a simple 2D plot where:

- **Close together** = sites have similar species  
- **Far apart** = sites have very different species  

Think of it like a map: sites in the same forest will cluster together, while grassland sites form their own cluster.

**You don't need to understand the maths**—just know how to read the plot!
:::

---

### 🟢 PERMANOVA vs ANOSIM: Testing for Differences

:::{.callout-tip}
## Which Test Should I Use?

**Use PERMANOVA** if:
- You have **multiple factors** (e.g., habitat × season)
- Your design is complex (interactions, nested factors)
- You want the most flexible, powerful option ✅

**Use ANOSIM** if:
- You have **one simple factor** (e.g., just comparing habitats)
- You prefer a simpler alternative
- Your demonstrator recommends it

💡 **In most cases, use PERMANOVA**—it's the modern standard.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What does PERMANOVA actually test? (Click to expand)

**PERMANOVA = Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance**

**In plain English:** It's like an ANOVA, but for community data. It asks:

> "Are the communities in Group A genuinely different from Group B, or could this pattern have happened by random chance?"

It works by:
1. Calculating how different sites are (using distance measures like Bray-Curtis)
2. Shuffling group labels thousands of times (999 permutations)
3. Seeing if your real groups are more different than the random shuffles

**If P < 0.05** → Groups ARE significantly different  
**If P > 0.05** → No convincing evidence of difference
:::

---

### 🟠 SIMPER: Finding the Culprits

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What is SIMPER? (Click to expand)

**SIMPER = Similarity Percentages**

**In plain English:** After PERMANOVA tells you "yes, these groups are different", SIMPER tells you **WHY**.

It identifies which species contribute most to the differences. For example:

- Forest sites have lots of **Species A** (75% contribution to difference)
- Grassland sites have lots of **Species B** (15% contribution)  
- Species C is everywhere (5% contribution—not very useful!)

**Use SIMPER ONLY after** you've found a significant difference with PERMANOVA/ANOSIM.
:::

---

## 🔨 The Analysis Workflow

Here's the roadmap for analysing community data:

```
1. Transform your data (reduce dominance of common species)
         ↓
2. Calculate similarity matrix (Bray-Curtis)
         ↓
3. Create nMDS plot (visualise patterns)
         ↓
4. Run PERMANOVA (test for differences)
         ↓
5. If significant → Run SIMPER (identify key species)
         ↓
6. Interpret & report!
```

## 💻 Step-by-Step: Using PRIMER 7

:::{.callout-important}
## R Users: Instructions on Canvas
If you prefer R over PRIMER, detailed R Studio files are available on Canvas. The concepts are the same—just different buttons!
:::

### Before You Start: Understanding Data Transformation

:::{.callout-warning}
## Why Transform Data?

Ecological data is messy. You might have:
- **1 super common species** (e.g., 500 individuals)
- **20 rare species** (1-2 individuals each)

Without transformation, the common species dominates everything and drowns out patterns from rarer species.

**Common transformations:**
- **4th root** → Good for abundance data with big numbers
- **Log(x+1)** → Good for moderate ranges  
- **Presence/absence** → Ignore abundance, just note if species is there

💡 **PRIMER won't let you proceed without transforming**—it's protecting you from bad analyses!
:::

---

### 📊 Step 1: Open Your Data

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa folder-open >}} Opening Files in PRIMER

1. Open your **Excel file** first (to check it looks right)
2. Launch **PRIMER 7**
3. Go to **File → Open** → Select your Excel file
4. Choose the correct **worksheet**
5. Set **"Data Type"** to **Sample data**
6. **Clear the "Title" button** (unless you want headers included)
7. Check: Does it show the right number of rows and columns? ✅
:::

---

### 🏷️ Step 2: Add Factors (Labels for Your Groups)

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa tag >}} Adding Factors

**Factors** are the groups you want to compare (e.g., "Forest" vs "Grassland", or "Burned" vs "Unburned")

1. Go to **Edit → Factors → Add**
2. Give your factor a clear name (e.g., "Habitat")
3. For each sample/site, assign its group (e.g., type "Forest" or "Grassland")
4. Press **OK**

💡 **Tip:** Use short, consistent labels—no spaces or special characters!
:::

---

### 🔄 Step 3: Transform the Data

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa shuffle >}} Transforming Data

1. Go to **Pre-treatment → Transform (overall)**
2. Choose your transformation:
   - **4th root** → For count data with large values
   - **Presence/absence** → If you only care whether species exist, not how many
3. Press **OK**

**The data now lives in a new worksheet**—keep the original safe!
:::

---

### 🗺️ Step 4: Create an nMDS Plot

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa chart-scatter >}} Making Your Ordination

**First, calculate similarities:**
1. Go to **Analyse → Resemblance**
2. Select **"Analyse between samples"**
3. Choose **Bray-Curtis similarity** (the standard for ecological data)
4. Click **OK** → This creates a similarity matrix

**Then, create the plot:**
5. Go to **Analyse → Non-metric MDS**
6. Change **number of restarts to 20** (makes it more reliable)
7. Tick **Configuration Plot**
8. Click **OK**

**Customise your plot:**
- **Right-click** on the plot to change colours, add labels, etc.
- Try colour-coding by your factor to see if groups separate!
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Reading Your nMDS Plot

- **Closer points** = more similar communities
- **Look for clusters**—do your treatment groups separate?
- **Stress value** (shown on plot):
  - **< 0.1** = Excellent representation  
  - **0.1–0.2** = Good  
  - **> 0.2** = Treat with caution
:::

---

### 🧪 Step 5: Run PERMANOVA (Test for Differences)

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa flask >}} Running the Statistical Test

**A. Create the Design:**
1. Return to the **Resemblance Matrix** (the similarity matrix you made)
2. Go to **PERMANOVA+ → Create PERMANOVA Design**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Habitat_test")
4. Enter the **number of factors** (usually 1 or 2)
5. For each factor:
   - Type its name
   - Choose **Fixed** (almost always) or **Random** (rare—ask if unsure)
6. Press **OK**

**B. Run the Test:**
7. Go to **PERMANOVA+ → PERMANOVA**
8. Select your design (if multiple, pick the one with the highest number)
9. Choose these settings:
   - **Main test** ✅
   - **Reduced model** (permutation type)
   - **Type III sum of squares**
   - **999 permutations**
10. Click **OK**

**C. Read the Results:**
- Look for the **P-value**
- **P < 0.05** → Groups are significantly different! 🎉
- **P > 0.05** → No evidence of difference
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## What If You Have Multiple Groups?

If your PERMANOVA shows **P < 0.05** but you have 3+ groups (e.g., Forest, Grassland, Desert), you need **pairwise comparisons** to see which pairs differ:

1. Re-run PERMANOVA
2. Select **Pair-wise test**
3. Choose your factor
4. Click **OK**

This shows you: Forest vs Grassland (P = 0.003), Forest vs Desert (P = 0.021), etc.
:::

---

### 🔍 Step 6: Run SIMPER (Find Key Species)

:::{.callout-important}
## Only Do This If PERMANOVA Was Significant!
There's no point identifying "key species" if groups aren't actually different.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Identifying Driver Species

1. Return to your **transformed dataset** (not the resemblance matrix)
2. Go to **Analyse → SIMPER**
3. Select your factor (e.g., "Habitat")
4. Click **OK**

**Read the output:**
- Species are ranked by **contribution to dissimilarity**
- Top species = biggest drivers of difference
- **Cumulative %** shows when you've explained most of the pattern (often aim for ~70%)
:::

---

### 💾 Step 7: Save Your Work!

:::{.callout-warning}
**Don't forget to save!** PRIMER can crash, and you'll lose everything.

- Go to **File → Save As**
- Export plots as images (right-click → Export)
- Copy-paste tables into Word/Excel
:::

---

## 🔄 Alternative: ANOSIM (Simpler Test)

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## When and How to Use ANOSIM

**ANOSIM** is a simpler alternative to PERMANOVA for **one-factor designs only**.

### Running ANOSIM:
1. Return to your **Resemblance Matrix**
2. Go to **Analyse → ANOSIM**
3. Select your factor
4. Click **OK**

### Reading Results:
- Look for the **Global R** value and **Significance level**
- **Convert significance to P-value:** Divide by 100  
  (e.g., 0.2% → 0.2 ÷ 100 = P = 0.002)
- **Global R interpretation:**
  - **R close to 1** → Strong separation between groups
  - **R close to 0** → Little/no separation

### Reporting ANOSIM:
Write: "Global R = 0.148, P = 0.076, 999 permutations"

⚠️ **Only interpret pairwise tests if the Global Test is significant!**

## 📁 Homework: Prepare Your Data Files (5 Marks)

:::{.callout-important}
## Due: Start of Next Week's Practical

Your demonstrator will check and mark these three spreadsheets. **Get them right!**
:::

### File 1: Habitat Data for PCA (Jamovi/R)

```
Format: Sites in ROWS, variables in COLUMNS
```

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa table >}} Example Structure:

| Site_Name | Treatment | Canopy_Cover | Soil_Moisture | Temperature |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Site_A    | Forest    | 85           | 45            | 18.5        |
| Site_B    | Forest    | 90           | 50            | 17.8        |
| Site_C    | Grassland | 10           | 20            | 22.3        |

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Each site = one row
- ✅ Each variable = one column  
- ✅ Column for site names
- ✅ Column for treatment (if applicable)
- ✅ All measurements in consistent units
- ✅ No missing data (or marked clearly as "NA")
:::

---

### File 2: Community Data for PRIMER

```
Format: Species in ROWS, sites in COLUMNS
```

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa table >}} Example Structure:

|            | Site_A | Site_B | Site_C | Site_D |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Species_1** | 12     | 8      | 0      | 3      |
| **Species_2** | 5      | 7      | 15     | 20     |
| **Species_3** | 0      | 2      | 45     | 38     |

**Critical PRIMER requirements:**
- ✅ **Top-left cell MUST be blank** (PRIMER needs this!)
- ✅ Single header row with site names
- ✅ Species as rows, sites as columns
- ✅ Cell values = abundance (or 1/0 for presence/absence)
- ✅ No merged cells, no extra rows
- ✅ Keep a separate reference file if using codes (A, B, C) instead of full species names
:::

---

### File 3: Summary Statistics

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa calculator >}} Creating Summaries

Based on Files 1 & 2, calculate useful summaries:

**From Community Data:**
- Number of species per site (species richness)
- Total individuals per site  
- Total individuals per species (across all sites)

**From Habitat Data:**
- Mean/median habitat variables per treatment
- Range of values

### How to Do This in Excel:

**Option 1: Simple Formulas**
1. Make a copy of your community data
2. Add a column for row totals: `=SUM(B2:Z2)` (adjust range)
3. Sort by this total (select ALL data first!)
4. Delete species with zero total

**Option 2: Pivot Tables** (faster for summaries)
1. Select your dataset
2. **Data → Pivot Table** → New worksheet
3. Drag **Species** → Rows, **Sites** → Columns
4. Choose **Sum** for abundance or **Count** for presence/absence
:::

## ❓ Common Questions

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## "Do I need to use all the transformations?"

No! For next week's analysis, try **2-3 different transformations** and see how they affect your results. Common choices:
- 4th root (most common)
- Log(x+1)  
- Presence/absence (if you suspect rare species are important)

Document which you used and why.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## "What if my demonstrator wants me to use ANOSIM instead of PERMANOVA?"

That's fine! Both test similar hypotheses. ANOSIM is simpler but less flexible. Follow your demonstrator's preference.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## "Can I delete rare species from my data?"

Yes, but document it! You can:
- Delete species found at only 1 site (singletons)
- Group rare species by genus or family
- Keep everything (but transformation will help)

**Explain your choice in your report.**
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## "What's a 'good' stress value for nMDS?"

- **< 0.1** = Excellent—trust the plot!
- **0.1–0.2** = Good—patterns are reliable
- **> 0.2** = Poor—treat with caution, patterns might be misleading

If stress > 0.2, try more restarts or consider if your data is suitable for nMDS.
:::

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **During practical:** Ask your demonstrator!
- **Software issues:** Check Canvas for R alternatives or PRIMER tutorials  
- **Conceptual confusion:** Re-read the collapsed "What is..." sections above
- **Data formatting:** Look at the example images or ask for template files

**Remember:** Everyone finds this challenging at first. The software does the complicated maths—you just need to understand what the results mean! 🎓

### **Community structure/Assemblage structure**

The process for looking at community structure is straight forward. We will use both cluster analysis and nMDS/ANOSIM/SIMPER to do this. This involves;

* Transforming/standardising your data as appropriate.
* Calculating Bray Curtis dissimilarities (you could use something else from BC if the data are suitable) and generating dissimilarity matrix.
* Performing MDS (and follow on below).
* PERMANOVA (or ANOSIM) to test for difference between treatments.
* SIMPER for identifying which variables contribute to the differences.

#### **Using PRIMER 7 (R instructions are given on Canvas within an R Studio files)**

#### **PERMANOVA, SIMPER and MDS analysis with PRIMER**

**1\.**	**Open your data**

a. Open the **Excel file** containing your data.
b. Launch **PRIMER 7**.
c. In PRIMER, go to **File → Open**, then choose your Excel file.
d. Select the correct **worksheet** to analyse.
e. Ensure **“Data Type”** is set to **Sample data**.
f. **Clear the “Title” button** (unless you want a header included).
g. Check that your data has the expected **number of rows (samples)** and **columns (species/variables)** and looks correct.

**2\.**	 **Add factors**

a. Go to **Edit → Factors → Add**.
b. Give each factor a clear, meaningful name (e.g., "Habitat", "Season").
c. Code each sample/site with its appropriate level for the factor (e.g., “Forest” or “Grassland”).
d. Press **OK** to save the factor.

**3\. Transform the data (if needed)**

a. Go to **Pre-treatment → Transform (overall)**.
b. Choose a transformation appropriate for your data:
c. Use **4th root** for abundance/biomass data with large values.
d. Use **Presence/absence** if you’re only interested in species occurrence.
e. Press **OK** to apply the transformation.

**Create an nMDS Plot**

a. Go to **Analyse → Resemblance**.
b. Select **“Analyse between samples”** and choose **Bray-Curtis similarity**.
c. Click **OK** to generate the resemblance matrix.
d. Then go to **Analyse → Non-metric MDS**.
e. Change the **number of restarts to 20**.
f. Tick **Configuration Plot**, then click **OK**.
g. You can adjust the appearance of the nMDS by **right-clicking on the plot**.

**Run a PERMANOVA**

**A. Create the PERMANOVA Design**

a. Return to the **Resemblance Matrix**.
b. Go to **PERMANOVA+ → Create PERMANOVA Design**.
c. Enter a **name** for your design.
d. Add the **number of factors** you want to test (e.g., "Habitat", "Season").
e. For each factor:
f. Enter its name,
g. Choose **Fixed** or **Random** as appropriate.
h. Press **OK** to create the design.

**B. Run the PERMANOVA**

a. Go to **PERMANOVA+ → PERMANOVA**.
b. Select your newly created design (choose the one with the **highest number** if unsure).

d. Choose **Main test**,
e. Use **Reduced model** for permutation type,
f. Use **Type III sum of squares**,
g. Set **Number of permutations** to **999**.
h. Click **OK** to run the test.
i. **Interpret the output**: If a factor is significant (p \< 0.05), it suggests group differences.

**Pairwise Comparisons (if needed)**

a. If your PERMANOVA shows significant effects, re-run it:
b. Select **Pair-wise test**,
c. Choose the **factor or interaction** you want to explore in detail.
d. Click **OK**.

**Run a SIMPER Analysis**

a. Return to the **Transformed dataset**.
b. Go to **Analyse → SIMPER**.
c. Select the **factor** you’re interested in (e.g., "Habitat").
d. Click **OK**.
e. SIMPER identifies which species contribute most to the differences between groups.

**Save Your Work**

Save your results and graphs by going to **File → Save As**, or by exporting figures and tables as needed.

When analysing your group data in **Week 11**, you will have the option to apply **different transformations** to your dataset. It’s a good idea to **try several transformations** (e.g., 4th root, log(x+1), presence/absence) to explore how they influence your results and interpretations.

**Important**: PRIMER may **not allow you to proceed** with certain analyses—such as resemblance or ordination—if the data are **not transformed**. This is because untransformed ecological data often contain extreme values that can distort multivariate analyses.

So, always consider applying an appropriate transformation **before moving on** to steps like Bray-Curtis similarity, nMDS, PERMANOVA, or SIMPER.

### **ANOSIM – Analysis of Similarities**

**ANOSIM** is a non-parametric test used to assess whether there are significant differences between **groups** of samples. It is an alternative to PERMANOVA, but with some key differences:

* **ANOSIM is best suited for simple, one-factor analyses** (e.g., comparing habitats or treatments with one grouping variable).  
* **PERMANOVA** is more flexible and appropriate for **multi-factorial designs** (e.g., habitat × season).  
* For **one-factor designs**, ANOSIM and PERMANOVA typically produce **similar results**.

### **Running ANOSIM in PRIMER**

1. **Return to the Resemblance Matrix** (you must have already created this using Bray-Curtis or another similarity measure).  
2. Go to **Analyse → ANOSIM**.  
3. Select the **factor** you added earlier (e.g., “Treatment” or “Habitat”).  
4. Click **OK** to run the analysis.

### **Interpreting the ANOSIM Output**

* The key result is the **Global Test** section, which gives you:  
  * **Global R** value (effect size)  
  * **Significance level (in %)**, which is your p-value × 100

**To get the p-value**, divide the significance level by 100:  
 For example, if the significance level is **0.2%**, then:  
 0.2 ÷ 100 \= 0.002 → **P \= 0.002**, which is **statistically significant (P \< 0.05)**.

* If the **Significance level** is **greater than 5%** (i.e., **P \> 0.05**), then there is **no significant difference between groups**, even if pairwise comparisons appear significant.  
* ANOSIM results are typically reported like this:  
   **(Global R \= 0.148, P \= 0.076, 999 permutations)**

### **Important Notes**

* A **high Global R** (close to 1\) indicates strong separation between groups; values near 0 suggest little or no separation.  
* Only interpret **Pairwise Tests** if the **Global Test is significant**.  
* Always report the number of **permutations used** (usually 999 by default).

**What You Need to Prepare**

* By the **start of next week’s practical**, each group must have **three Excel spreadsheets** prepared. These will be checked and **marked out of 5** by your demonstrators.
* **1\. Habitat Data File**
  * Format for **Jamovi or R**  
  * **Rows \= sites**, **Columns \= habitat variables** (e.g., canopy cover, soil moisture, temperature)  
  * Ensure variable names are clear and units are consistent
* **2\. Assemblage / Community Data File**
  * Format for **PRIMER or R**  
  * **Rows \= species IDs**, **Columns \= sites**  
  * Each cell should contain abundance or presence/absence data for each species at each site
* **3\. Summary Statistics File**
  * Additional spreadsheets based on **Files 1 and 2**, but with calculated summaries  
  * Include statistics such as:  
    * Number of species per site or treatment  
    * Total individuals  
    * Mean or median values of habitat variables  
  * These can be summarised **by site** or **by treatment**, depending on your research question


### **Preparing Data for PCA, Community Analysis, and Summary Statistics**

Next week’s practical sessions will involve working with your collected data in **Jamovi**, **PRIMER**, and **Excel**. Below are step-by-step instructions to help you get your data in the right format.

### **1\. Habitat Data for PCA (Jamovi or R)**

You will need to enter your habitat data into **Jamovi** or **R** for **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**.

* Each **site** must have its **own row**.  
* Each **habitat variable** (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, canopy cover) should have its **own column**.  
* Include a **“Site Name”** column.  
* If your project includes treatments (e.g., burned vs unburned), include a **“Treatment”** column.  
* Ensure all measurements are in consistent units, and check for any missing data.

*Jamovi Tip*: Once imported, make sure your variables are recognised as **numeric** (ruler icon), not text.

### **2\. Assemblage / Community Data for PRIMER**

You will also need to prepare your species data for multivariate analysis in **PRIMER**.

* Create a **species × site matrix**:  
  * **Rows \= species**  
  * **Columns \= sites**  
  * **Cell values \= abundance** (or presence/absence)  
* The **top-left cell** of the spreadsheet must be blank (PRIMER requires this).  
* Use a **single header row** with column labels (site names), and no extra rows or merged cells.  
* Species names can be replaced with unique codes (e.g., A, B, C), but you must keep a **separate reference file** that maps these codes to their full species names (e.g., A \= Toyota Corolla, B \= Leyland P76).

### **3. Summary Statistics for Additional (Univariate) Analyses**

To support univariate analyses (e.g., total species per site, total abundance), prepare a separate summary spreadsheet:

#### **🔧 Steps:**

1. Make a **copy** of your completed species × site matrix.  
2. In a **new column** at the far right, use Excel formulas (e.g., \=SUM(...)) to calculate the **total abundance per species** (i.e., row totals).  
3. Select the entire dataset (very important\!) and **sort by this new column**.  
4. Delete rows with a total of **zero** (species not present in any site).  
5. You may consider **grouping rare species** or singletons into coarser taxonomic levels (e.g., genus or family), if appropriate for your analysis.

### **Using Pivot Tables to Calculate Summary Statistics**

**Pivot tables** in Excel can help you quickly calculate total counts or presence/absence summaries across sites.

#### **To create a Pivot Table:**
