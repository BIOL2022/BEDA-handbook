**Science is about asking the right questions in the right way so we can draw meaningful conclusions from the data we collect.**
This is not as simple as it seems, but it is a key skill in scientific enquiry. We need to be able to ask questions in a quantitative way to distinguish between different explanations for the things we observe. *Before* we start using t-tests, regression, or ANOVA; before we perform mixed modelling or moltivariate analyses; before we use the *newest* tools for data analysis, **we must first learn to ask the right questions**. So letâ€™s go back to basics. 

In this module:

- **Lectures (Weeks 1 --5)** will cover the fundamental principles of scientific enquiry, including how to ask the right questions, how to design a study, and how to interpret results. We will also introduce to you the linear modelling framework, which is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between variables in your data.
- **Practicals (Weeks 1--3)** aim to help you build the essential skills for scientific enquiry. We will cover experimental design, model formulation, and sampling design. Each week begins with a short 30-minute workshop to introduce the main ideas and techniques. You will then complete the practical work.
