## Intro to the practicals

Welcome to the first workshop of BEDA. The workshops are designed to help you learn specific skills, understand the practicals and to provide you with an opportunity to ask questions. **Workshops are run only in Module 1 (Januar).**

As this is the first workshop we will start with a brief introduction to the practicals and the software we will be using. 

## Software

### R and RStudio

- Download R [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
- Download RStudio Desktop from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- If necessary, you can sign up to RStudio Cloud [here](https://posit.cloud/). This applies to those of you who have trouble installing R and RStudio on your computer, and somehow still prefer this to the other software options.

You must have both installed on your computer. If you already have them installed, please make sure they are up-to-date. Once installed, **make sure that you run R via RStudio Desktop** and *not* the base R GUI.

### Jamovi an JASP

- Download Jamovi from [here](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). 
- Unless you have reason to **not** use Jamovi, download JASP from [here](https://jasp-stats.org/download/).
 - For JASP, refer to [JASP Materials](https://jasp-stats.org/jasp-materials/#manuals) for documentation and more. JASP has an interface that is almost identical to Jamovi, so we will not cover it in detail here.

For Jamovi, the **current** branch is recommended. Remember -- if you are on a Mac with Apple Silicon, download the arm64 version for a slightly better performance.


### SPSS

- SPSS is only available on University computers. Check your lab computers for availability.
- Alternatively, you can use the University's [Citrix Workspace](https://uniconnect.cloud.com/Citrix/StoreWeb/#/login) to access SPSS.

 While I don't use SPSS myself, we do provide support for it in BEDA. It is somewhat of mixed bag right now as it has R integration, is point-and-click, and also has a syntax editor for scripting analyses.

### PRIMER v7

- This software is only used in Module 3 when we cover multivariate analysis. 
- Similar to SPSS, PRIMER is only available on University computers. **When we get to Module 3, we will provide more information on how to access it.**
