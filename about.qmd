Many students think of BEDA as yet another statistics unit. This is not quite true. Unlike most other statistical units, BEDA focuses on the **practical** aspects of data analysis. We assume that you already have a basic understanding of statistical concepts, and we build on that knowledge, focusing on the **how** and **why** of statistical methods:

- *How* do we design a good study?
- *Why* does study design make a difference in the results we get?
- *Why* is it important to understand the context in which we use statistical tests?

Importantly, **attending labs is crucial to your learning** as most of the data we use are collected by you â€“ please do not skip any of them!
