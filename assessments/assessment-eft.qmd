title: "Early Feedback Task"
---

## Overview
 In this assessment you will complete a quiz and write a short reflection (about 100 words) on how things are going (so far). Tell us what you've learned, any challenges you’re facing, and what you’d like to improve. The goal is to help you reflect on whether you are actually prepared for BEDA. We can also use the information you provide to better support you moving forward.

Think of it as a check-in, not a test. The questions are designed to help you identify areas where you may need to focus your study efforts.

*   **Weighting:** 5%
*   **Due Date:** Friday, Week 4, 11:59 PM 

**With EFTs, we may reach out to you to provide additional support or resources based on your responses.**
