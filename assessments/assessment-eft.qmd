title: "Early Feedback Task"
---

## Overview
In this assessment you will complete a quick survey and write a short reflection (about 100 words) on how things are going (so far). Tell us what you've learned, any challenges you’re facing, and what you’d like to improve. The goal is to help you reflect on whether you are actually prepared for BEDA. We want to make sure that you are ready to tackle the challenges ahead and this task will help us understand how we can support you better.

Think of it as a check-in, not a test—no trick questions, and definitely no pop quizzes.
