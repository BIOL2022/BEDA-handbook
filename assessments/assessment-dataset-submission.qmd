- This is a group assessment: only one group member needs to upload the data file (Excel format) to Canvas on behalf of the group.
- The dataset must be submitted before your Week 11 practical session.
- It is worth 5% of your total unit mark.
- Near-perfect datasets that are well-organised, correctly formatted, and ready for analysis will receive the full 5%.
- As this is a group submission, Special Consideration, Simple Extensions, and Academic Plans do not apply.
